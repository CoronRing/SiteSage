# Traffic & Accessibility Scoring Rubric

## Evaluation Criteria

Score the traffic and accessibility analysis on a scale of 0-10 based on the following criteria:

---

## 1. Public Transit Coverage (35% weight)

### Excellent (9-10 points)

- Multiple transit types identified (subway, bus, metro)
- Specific counts at different radii (500m, 1000m, 1500m)
- Distance to nearest transit points calculated
- Walking times estimated
- Transit frequency/service quality mentioned
- Clear assessment of transit adequacy

### Good (7-8 points)

- 2+ transit types covered
- Counts at 2+ radii
- Distances provided
- Basic adequacy assessment

### Adequate (5-6 points)

- 1-2 transit types
- Basic counts
- Some distance information
- General assessment

### Poor (3-4 points)

- Vague transit references
- No specific distances
- Incomplete coverage

### Insufficient (0-2 points)

- No transit information
- Unable to assess accessibility

---

## 2. Pedestrian & Vehicular Access (25% weight)

### Excellent (9-10 points)

- Parking availability assessed (counts, types, distances)
- Walkability evaluated (sidewalks, pedestrian zones)
- Road network and connections discussed
- Foot traffic patterns analyzed
- Vehicle accessibility rated
- Considers multiple access modes

### Good (7-8 points)

- Parking assessed
- Basic walkability discussed
- Some access mode coverage

### Adequate (5-6 points)

- Parking mentioned
- Limited walkability info
- Minimal detail

### Poor (3-4 points)

- Vague parking references
- No walkability assessment

### Insufficient (0-2 points)

- No parking/access information

---

## 3. Target Customer Accessibility Fit (20% weight)

### Excellent (9-10 points)

- Explicitly connects transit options to target demographics
- Discusses whether access modes match customer preferences
- Considers customer mobility patterns (work, school, leisure)
- Assesses convenience for target segments
- References customer analysis insights

### Good (7-8 points)

- Discusses customer-transit fit
- Some demographic consideration
- Basic convenience assessment

### Adequate (5-6 points)

- Mentions target customers
- General fit discussion

### Poor (3-4 points)

- Minimal customer connection
- No fit assessment

### Insufficient (0-2 points)

- No customer consideration
- Ignores target demographics

---

## 4. Traffic Implications & Opportunities (20% weight)

### Excellent (9-10 points)

- Discusses expected foot traffic volumes
- Identifies peak traffic times
- Assesses traffic flow benefits/challenges
- Considers visibility and discoverability
- Identifies accessibility-based opportunities
- Discusses commuter vs. leisure traffic patterns

### Good (7-8 points)

- Traffic volume discussed
- Peak times mentioned
- Some opportunities identified

### Adequate (5-6 points)

- Basic traffic discussion
- Limited opportunity analysis

### Poor (3-4 points)

- Vague traffic references
- No opportunity identification

### Insufficient (0-2 points)

- No traffic implications discussed

## Scoring Formula

**Final Score = (Transit × 0.35) + (Access × 0.25) + (Customer Fit × 0.20) + (Implications × 0.20)**

Round to 1 decimal place.

---

## Justification Requirements

The evaluation must include:

1. **Strengths**: What the analysis does well (2-3 specific points)
2. **Weaknesses**: What could be improved (1-2 specific points)
3. **Key Findings**: Most important accessibility insights
4. **Score Breakdown**: Brief explanation of how each criterion scored
5. **Overall Assessment**: 2-3 sentence summary of accessibility strength

## Example Scoring

**Analysis Excerpt**: "Location has excellent public transit access with 2 subway stations within 400m (5-min walk) and 4 bus stops within 300m. For the target student demographic, this is ideal as they primarily use public transit. Parking is limited (2 small lots within 800m), but this is acceptable given the customer profile. High foot traffic expected during morning (7-9am) and afternoon (4-6pm) peak commute times."

**Score Breakdown**:

- Public Transit: 9/10 (excellent coverage, specific distances, clear assessment)
- Access: 7/10 (parking assessed, good walkability discussion, some vehicle access gaps)
- Customer Fit: 9/10 (explicit student-transit connection, clear reasoning)
- Implications: 8/10 (peak times identified, foot traffic discussed, opportunities noted)

**Final Score: 8.4/10**
