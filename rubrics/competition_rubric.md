# Competition Analysis Scoring Rubric

## Evaluation Criteria

Score the competition analysis on a scale of 0-10 based on the following criteria:

---

## 1. Competitor Mapping & Density (35% weight)

### Excellent (9-10 points)

- Competitors counted at multiple radii (500m, 1000m, 1500m+)
- Specific competitor counts with exact numbers
- Competitor types identified (direct vs. indirect)
- Distance to nearest competitor calculated
- Competitor distribution pattern analyzed (clustered vs. dispersed)
- Clear density assessment relative to market norms

### Good (7-8 points)

- Counts at 2+ radii
- Specific numbers provided
- Nearest competitor identified
- Basic density assessment

### Adequate (5-6 points)

- Basic competitor counts
- Single radius data
- General proximity info

### Poor (3-4 points)

- Vague competitor references
- No specific counts
- Limited mapping

### Insufficient (0-2 points)

- No competitor data
- Unable to assess competition

---

## 2. Market Saturation Assessment (30% weight)

### Excellent (9-10 points)

- Clear saturation evaluation (oversaturated, balanced, undersaturated)
- Compares competitor density to industry benchmarks
- Considers population-to-competitor ratio
- Discusses market capacity and demand
- Assesses whether market can support additional entrants

### Adequate (5-6 points)

- General saturation statement
- Limited analysis
- Minimal evidence

### Poor (3-4 points)

- Vague saturation claims
- No supporting analysis

### Insufficient (0-2 points)

- No saturation assessment

## 3. Synthesis with Customer & Traffic Analyses (20% weight)

### Excellent (9-10 points)

- Integrates customer demographics with competition density
- Discusses whether customer base supports additional competitors
- Considers how accessibility affects competitive dynamics
- Identifies gaps or opportunities based on customer-traffic-competition fit
- Clear three-way synthesis with specific insights

### Good (7-8 points)

- Some integration
- Basic synthesis

### Adequate (5-6 points)

- Mentions customer or traffic
- Limited connection
- Minimal synthesis

### Poor (3-4 points)

- No reference to previous analyses
- Siloed competition view

### Insufficient (0-2 points)

- Completely isolated analysis
- Ignores previous insights

---

## 4. Competitive Positioning & Strategy (15% weight)

### Excellent (9-10 points)

- Identifies differentiation opportunities
- Discusses positioning strategies
- Suggests competitive advantages to pursue
- Considers market gaps and underserved segments
- Provides actionable strategic insights
- Risk assessment included

### Good (7-8 points)

- Positioning discussed
- Some opportunities identified
- Basic strategy suggestions

### Adequate (5-6 points)

- General positioning comments
- Limited strategic depth

### Poor (3-4 points)

- Vague strategy mentions
- No actionable insights

### Insufficient (0-2 points)

- No positioning discussion

## Scoring Formula

**Final Score = (Mapping × 0.35) + (Saturation × 0.30) + (Synthesis × 0.20) + (Strategy × 0.15)**

Round to 1 decimal place.

---

## Justification Requirements

The evaluation must include:

1. **Strengths**: What the analysis does well (2-3 specific points)
2. **Weaknesses**: What could be improved (1-2 specific points)
3. **Key Findings**: Most important competitive insights
4. **Score Breakdown**: Brief explanation of how each criterion scored
5. **Overall Assessment**: 2-3 sentence summary of competitive landscape

## Example Scoring

**Analysis Excerpt**: "Found 5 coffee shops within 1000m (3 within 500m, 2 additional within 1000m). Nearest competitor is 180m away. However, given the large student population (8,450 within 500m) and excellent transit access bringing customers from wider area, the market can support additional coffee shops. Current ratio is 1 coffee shop per 1,690 residents, which is reasonable for an urban area. Opportunity exists for a student-focused café with affordable pricing and study-friendly environment - a gap in current offerings."

**Score Breakdown**:

- Mapping: 9/10 (excellent counts at multiple radii, specific distances, clear density)
- Saturation: 9/10 (clear assessment, population ratio calculated, capacity discussed)
- Synthesis: 9/10 (integrates customer and traffic data, clear three-way synthesis)
- Strategy: 8/10 (specific positioning opportunity identified, actionable insight)

**Final Score: 8.9/10**
