## Example Scoring

**Analysis Excerpt**: "Population within 500m: 8,450 residents. Age distribution: 18-24 (35%), 25-34 (28%), 35-44 (18%), 45+ (19%). The high concentration of young professionals and students aligns perfectly with the target demographic for a boutique coffee shop."

**Score Breakdown**:

- Population Metrics: 7/10 (good data at one radius, but lacks multiple radii)
- Demographics: 9/10 (excellent age breakdown with percentages, clear target fit)
- Target Alignment: 9/10 (explicit connection, clear reasoning)
- Quality: 8/10 (insightful, concise, well-structured)

**Final Score: 8.1/10**
