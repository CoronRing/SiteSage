# Evaluation Scores

## Customer Analysis: 3.8/10
The report itself emphasizes this is a destination‑type riverside/park/arts coffee location rather than a commuter or downstairs community store, which drives the scores. For (1), although the 1 km catchment has ~46k residents and some offices, only a small subset will pass the storefront ≥3 weekdays/week; most flows are walkers, runners, museum visitors, and hotel guests on irregular patterns, so the repeat base is weak (estimated deterministic daily cups from true repeat users likely well below 120), fitting the 3.0–4.9 band. For (2), the analysis explicitly notes the site is not suitable for early‑peak commuter coffee and is oriented to evenings and weekends; morning path traffic from repeat commuters is minimal, making a low score in the 0.0–2.9 band appropriate. For (3), the report estimates total ‘可触达’ flows of 2,300–4,100 person‑times/day on an average day including weekends and holidays, with weekday leisure likely towards the lower end, so reachable irregular leisure passers are in the low‑thousands—consistent with a weak to low‑moderate leisure score (3.0–4.9). For (4), the storefront faces the riverside promenade and is embedded in the main walking/running/skateboard/basketball micro‑zone; for those already in this node, a large share naturally pass or see the store with no detour, supporting a high exposure score in the 7.5–8.9 band. For (5), the report notes potential competition in nearby museums and malls but gives no evidence of dense coffee clustering right on the same path; overall deterministic node demand appears modest but not negligible, suggesting a ‘tight but not oversupplied’ situation in the 5.0–7.4 band. For (6), flows depend heavily on park/arts traffic, weather, and events—so they are more volatile than a CBD, yet West Bund/滨江公园 is a strategic, policy‑backed long‑term node with multiple anchors, which fits a neutral/uncertain but not negative stability band (5.0–7.4). For (7), the mix of young art visitors, sports users, hotel guests, and a solid working‑age resident base indicates a good proportion of target specialty‑coffee users and mid‑to‑high discretionary spending, justifying a ‘good fit’ score above 7.5. Combining these with the specified weights yields an overall customer‑potential score of 3.8, and the low commuter/morning components impose no additional cap beyond this value.

## Traffic & Accessibility: 2.1/10
For a weekday-morning, commuter-focused specialty coffee shop, this riverside site scores poorly on core commuter dimensions despite being strong for leisure traffic. A) Morning pass-by at the storefront is very low: the analysis estimates total daily riverside footfall at only 2,300–4,100, dominated by runners, strollers, and art visitors, with the main peaks in early morning and evenings and heavier on weekends; for 07:00–10:00 on typical weekdays the likely passers within 0–30 m are well under 1,000, so A = 1.0. B) The shop is on the riverfront recreation path, not on natural paths between metro, offices, and homes, meaning most office or residential commuters would need substantial backtracking away from desire lines, commonly >8 minutes round-trip, so detour fit for commuters is poor (B = 2.0). C) The report explicitly frames the area as leisure/arts/滨江目的地型, with weak office commuting and very limited ‘上班顺路买咖啡’; peaks are linked to exercise and leisure rather than stable weekday commuter waves, so commuter share of traffic is low and C = 3.0. D) Macro transit capture is weak for commuter purposes: two metro nodes (龙华中路, 大木桥路) are 1.0–1.3 km away, beyond the 600–800 m comfort radius, and flows from those stations naturally head to art venues and the riverfront rather than forming a high-volume station→office commuter corridor past the store, so D is scored at a weak 3.5. E) Within 1 km, the analysis cites about 46,000 residents plus some office stock, implying a medium combined base (likely 40,000–80,000 people), so E = 5.5. F) There is effectively no captive same-building or same-podium population: this is a standalone riverside spot with no linked office towers or hotel directly above, so F is minimal at 1.0. G) In terms of commuter desire lines, the unit is essentially destination-only on a park/riverfront path, not on any transit→office route or internal project spine, so visibility for commuters is very weak (G = 1.5) even though it is visible to leisure users on the promenade. H) Car and parking access is actually strong, with an estimated 800–1,200 parking spaces within a 700 m radius and the closest lots only 120–200 m away, making it easy for self-driving visitors (H = 8.0). When these sub-scores are weighted per the rubric, the overall traffic & accessibility score for a commuter-focused concept is 2.1/10, well below average and constrained further by the low pass-by, poor commuter path fit, and minimal captive population caps.

## Competition Analysis: 5.1/10
The report implies a modest RSV for the new store: it explicitly frames realistic volume in the ~110–330 to 400 cups/day range, with its own conservative estimate of 70–200 and an upper bound of ~400 cups/day in a highly weather- and weekend-dependent riverfront node, which fits the rubric’s weak-to-lower-adequate band (RSV <350) and supports an Effective Node Volume score of 4.5. Saturation is clearly high: 1 km holds ~35–40 coffee/tea outlets, the immediate 500 m riverfront belt has 8–12 shops, and the author repeatedly describes the area as a “高度集聚的目的地咖啡带” and “数量上接近饱和”, indicating that additional supply largely cannibalises existing demand; this justifies a Poor-ish saturation score around 4.0 rather than Good, despite only ~4–6 outlets within an estimated 300 m. At the same time, the analysis makes a strong, specific case for positioning white space: long-stay comfort, family/senior friendliness, health/运动功能, and accessible “艺术客厅” roles are all described as under-served versus nearby Manner, Birdie Cup, %Arabica, Unir, and museum cafés, with an argued upside of >150–250 incremental cups/day versus a generic offer, fitting the rubric’s “Good” 7.0–8.9 band; hence 8.0. Anchor/Incumbent risk is meaningful but not extreme: two strong chains (Manner, Birdie Cup) are within ~83–135 m on the same riverside flow, plus other majors (Starbucks, %Arabica, Unir) at 300–600 m, yet no hero flagship sits within 0–25 m; this aligns with the rubric’s “Good” range where there are 1–2 strong chains within 100 m on the same flow but strong node character, so 7.5 is appropriate. Weighted together (65% volume, 15% saturation, 10% white space, 10% anchor risk) these scores yield a final node score of 5.1, consistent with an adequately viable but competitively tight riverfront location that depends heavily on clear differentiation rather than raw traffic strength.
