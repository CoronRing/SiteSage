# Weighting Rationale

- **Store context**
  - Coffee shop located on B2 of Réel Mall, Nanjing West Road, Shanghai (prime urban retail corridor).
  - Mall-based, enclosed environment: internal foot traffic patterns and vertical access are critical.

- **Customer (0.30)**
  - Coffee appeals to a broad demographic; not an ultra-niche concept.
  - Still important to align with mall visitor profile (office workers, shoppers, tourists) and their spending power and visit frequency.
  - Set at the lower end of the coffee shop customer range (0.30–0.33) because broad appeal reduces the need for very tight demographic targeting.

- **Traffic & Accessibility (0.40)**
  - Primary success driver: relies on high, recurring foot traffic from mall visitors and nearby office workers.
  - B2 location makes visibility, wayfinding, and proximity to escalators, transit exits, and anchors especially important.
  - Coffee is a high-frequency, often impulse or convenience purchase; being on natural paths (to F&B zones, supermarket, transit access) is crucial.
  - Therefore given the top weight, at the high end of the coffee shop range.

- **Competition (0.30)**
  - Prime Shanghai malls typically host multiple beverage and café options (international chains, local brands, tea concepts).
  - Customers face low switching costs and can easily choose another café or drink option on the same level.
  - However, strong overall mall traffic can support several players, and differentiation via brand, quality, and ambiance is possible.
  - Assigned a moderate weight (0.30), consistent with coffee shop guidance, recognizing competition is important but not more so than traffic.

- **Overall balance**
  - Weights sum to 1.0 and align with coffee shop / café rubric: traffic/accessibility as the dominant factor, with customer and competition both important but secondary.
  - Reflects a mall-based, high-traffic, broadly targeted coffee concept rather than a niche destination café.
