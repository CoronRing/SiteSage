# Evaluation Scores

## Customer Analysis: 6.7/10
The report positions the site in a prime Jing’an CBD/mall/metro node and credibly estimates 15,000–30,000 B2 passer‑bys per weekday within direct frontage, but it does not clearly separate repeat vs. leisure flows. Based on the described mix (large office worker base, heavy metro commuter use, plus substantial tourist/shopping traffic), a conservative assumption of roughly 50–60% repeat users implies around 7,500–18,000 repeat passers and perhaps 120–300 weekday cups from them, placing criterion (1) in the mid ‘moderate repeat base’ band (6.5). Applying a similar split to a realistic morning share of flows gives ~2,000–5,000 morning repeat passers and 100-ish cups in 3 hours, consistent with a ‘moderate morning peak’ score around 6.0 for criterion (2). Non‑commuter leisure flows are also strong (likely 7,000–12,000 distinct leisure passers and 30–100 incremental cups) but not overwhelming versus the repeat base, so criterion (3) is moderately high (6.0). The analysis implies the unit is on a main B2 F&B/metro-linked corridor—no security gates, minimal detours, and a large fraction of node flows channelled past the storefront—supporting a ‘good to high’ exposure rating (about 8.2) for criterion (4). However, the author explicitly notes “intense competition” from multiple coffee and beverage brands in the mall and surrounding West Nanjing Road corridor, so despite high node-wide coffee demand, the per‑operator share is likely tight, yielding a mid‑band competition score (6.0) for criterion (5). The macro-node (West Nanjing Road/Jing’an Temple with Réel Mall, multiple top-tier malls, and a major three-line metro interchange) is very mature, diversified, and structurally stable, justifying a high stability score (9.3) for criterion (6). Finally, the reachable customer mix—Grade A/B office workers, affluent shoppers, hotel guests, and young urban visitors in Shanghai’s premium fashion district—matches specialty coffee demographics extremely well, warranting an ‘excellent fit’ score around 9.2 for criterion (7). Applying the rubric’s weights to these subscores yields an overall customer potential score of 6.7, with no global caps triggered, reflecting a strong but competition-constrained, repeat‑leaning CBD mall site rather than an absolute top-tier commuter funnel.

## Traffic & Accessibility: 6.1/10
The report describes very strong overall footfall and transit access but a more moderate fit for pure weekday-morning commuter coffee. For A, corridor pass-by is quoted as ~15,000–30,000 people/day at the storefront, but no specific 07:00–10:00 figures are given and the unit is on B2 in a mall, so it is conservatively treated as a secondary morning path, yielding a moderate 5. For B, the analysis explicitly estimates an extra 2–4 minutes one way for many metro→office commuters and 2–5 minutes round-trip versus streetfront cafés, plus vertical circulation, which aligns with a 4–7 minute typical detour and some friction, so 6 (moderate) is appropriate. For C, the area has 50–70k nearby office workers, heavy metro commuter use, and explicit mention of commuter flows using the mall at breakfast, but also substantial leisure/shopping and tourist traffic; this matches a commuter-strong mixed profile at 7. For D, Jing’an Temple Station with 3 lines and 250k–300k daily entries/exits sits within ~60–200 m and has built-in mall connections, meaning a large share of a very big hub is realistically capturable, supporting a strong 8. For E, combining ~107k working-age residents within 1.5 km and 50–70k office workers within 800 m clearly exceeds the 160k base threshold and fits the ‘very dense core’ band, so 9. For F, while mall visitor volumes are high, the report does not quantify directly linked upstairs office towers; the reliably captive on-site base is therefore treated as modest (mall workers, some podium/office integration), consistent with 3,000–6,999 captive users and a score of 5. For G, the unit is on the main B2 F&B corridor with 15,000–30,000 daily passers-by and faces dense competing shopfronts, implying strong internal visibility once in B2 but requiring customers to penetrate into the mall, which aligns with a 7 for ‘strong’ in-project placement rather than prime. For H, the report cites substantial structured parking in Réel and adjacent complexes (area total 2,000–3,000+ stalls) but also highlights congestion and high pricing that make car trips less ideal for quick coffee, matching an ‘adequate’ to ‘good’ profile and supporting a 6. These component scores produce a weighted overall traffic & accessibility score of 6.1 without triggering any global caps.

## Competition Analysis: 4.8/10
Based on the report, the Réel B2 corridor has very high raw traffic (≈15,000–30,000 passers/day), but the micro-location is heavily contested by 5–8 direct coffee sellers on essentially the same paths, plus many more within 300 m. The analysis itself implies a realistic target of roughly 150–300 cups/day for a new entrant, which places the node in the weak-to-lower-adequate RSV band; this supports an Effective Node Volume score around 4.5 (RSV ≈250–350), consistent with high total demand but low achievable share. Saturation is clearly elevated: there are 7 direct coffee outlets within ≈100 m and ≈23–25 within 300 m, with an estimated 60–90 coffee-related outlets within 800 m; however, the report also shows a very large demand pool and no explicit evidence of widespread weak/empty units, so Saturation & Per-capita Competition is best scored in the “Adequate” range at 5.8 rather than “Poor” or “Extreme.” On positioning, the report identifies several credible but execution-dependent niches (specialty craft focus, health/functional, third-place seating, or speed champion) yet also states that generic mid-priced latte positioning would be suicidal given Manner, Starbucks, Tims, M Stand, etc.; this yields only moderate, not dramatic, white space and supports an “Adequate” Positioning White Space score of 6.0. Anchor and incumbent risk is substantial: within ~60 m there are multiple strong chains (M Stand, Starbucks, Manner nearby, Tims slightly further) plus boutique players and bakery-cafés, many on the same B2 circulation, implying constant direct comparison and strong app/discount ecosystems; this matches the “Poor” band and justifies an Anchor / Incumbent Risk score of 4.0. Weighted together, these criteria produce a final competition favorability score of 4.8, reflecting a node where macro demand is strong but micro-level competitive pressure and anchor strength severely constrain a new store’s sustainable volume unless it differentiates very effectively.
