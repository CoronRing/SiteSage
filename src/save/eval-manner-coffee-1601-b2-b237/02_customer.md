## 2. Demographics Around the Site

Population data are residential only and underestimate total daytime/mobile population (office workers, tourists, commuters, etc.), which are very significant here.

### 2.1 Population & Age Composition

Data source: WorldPop (GCJ-02), centered on 31.222981, 121.447061.

| Radius | Total Population | 0–14 yrs | 15–59 yrs | 60–64 yrs | 65+ yrs |
|--------|------------------|----------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| 300 m  | 4,639            | 331 (7.1%) | 2,619 (56.5%) | 441 (9.5%) | 1,168 (25.2%) |
| 800 m  | 39,134           | 3,080 (7.9%) | 22,591 (57.7%) | 3,583 (9.2%) | 10,013 (25.6%) |
| 1,500 m| 183,927          | 15,957 (8.7%) | 107,128 (58.2%) | 15,897 (8.6%) | 45,190 (24.6%) |

**Key points:**

- **Core coffee-drinking age (15–59)**:  
  - 300 m: ~2,600 residents  
  - 800 m: ~22,600 residents  
  - 1,500 m: ~107,000 residents  
- High proportions of **older residents (65+) ~25%**, but this inner-city district also has:
  - Dense **office population** and **tourists/shoppers** not counted above.
  - High spending power according to West Nanjing Road district description (premium brands, high rents).

For a **coffee shop in a mall**, the more relevant “catchment” is:

- **Immediate capture zone**: inside Réel Mall and connected metro exits.  
- **Walkable urban zone**: ~300–800 m radius – offices, hotels, other malls, Jing’an Temple, Jing’an Park, etc.

---

## 3. Nearby Places & Functional Environment (≤1.2 km)

Using nearby-place data and local knowledge of the area; focus on categories relevant to coffee demand.

### 3.1 Retail & Malls

- **Réel Mall (芮欧百货)** – the host mall  
  - Distance: 0 m (on B2)  
  - Positioning: mid- to high-end fashion, lifestyle, F&B.
- **Jiuguang Department Store (久光百货)**  
  - Distance: ~150–200 m NE  
  - Large department store; generates sustained shopper flow.
- **Jing’an Temple commercial plazas & “Fengshengli 静安寺广场 / 丰盛里”**  
  - 50 m west (listed as 丰盛里·静安寺广场)  
  - Mixed open-air retail, dining and event space.
- **Plaza 66, Jing’an Kerry Centre, etc. (West Nanjing Rd corridor)**  
  - Within ~500–900 m east/northeast; major high-end malls and office towers.

These collectively form a continuous shopping spine, with overlapping shopper flows.

### 3.2 Transport Hubs

- **Jing’an Temple Metro Station (静安寺地铁站)** – Lines 2, 7, 14  
  - Multiple exits (1–10, 15) visible in the data, all within 50–200 m.  
  - One of Shanghai’s **busiest interchange stations** on Line 2 (main east–west artery) and Line 7/14.  
  - Public data for this specific station’s ridership are scarce, but by comparison with similar core stations:
    - Conservative assumption: **250,000–300,000 entries+exits per weekday**.
- **Bus junctions / surface traffic**: Several bus stops around Jing’an Temple and Nanjing Rd; add to pedestrian flow into the area.

### 3.3 Offices, Hotels, Residential

(From nearby-place data and known urban structure; only the most relevant named examples shown.)

- **Office / mixed-use towers** (mostly within 300–800 m)  
  - Towers around Plaza 66, Jing’an Kerry Centre, and along Nanjing West Road and Yan’an Rd.  
  - Reasonable conservative estimate: **50,000–70,000 office workers** within 800 m.
- **Hotels (4–5 star)** within ~500 m:  
  - Example in data: **The Portman Ritz-Carlton (璞丽酒店)** at ~150 m east (approx. mapped as “璞丽酒店”).  
  - Multiple other high-end hotels along West Nanjing Road and Yan’an Elevated Road.  
  - Conservative: **2,000–3,000 hotel rooms** in walking distance; at 70% occupancy, ~1,400–2,100 guests per night.
- **Residential**  
  - Inner-ring, dense but partly older stock.  
  - Residential population already quantified above: **~39k residents within 800 m**, roughly half in core coffee-consuming age.

### 3.4 Schools, Universities, Tourist Attractions, Hospitals

- **Tourist / cultural attractions** (within 200–300 m):
  - **Jing’an Temple (静安寺)** – major historic temple and tourist site.
  - **Jing’an Park (静安公园)** – directly south and southwest, multiple named segments:
    - “儿同乐园”, “静安公园-中心湖”, “静安公园-八景园”, etc.
- **Estimated tourist/visitor flows** (based on typical urban temple/park usage in central Shanghai):
  - Jing’an Temple: assume **3,000–6,000 visitors/day** on ordinary days, more on holidays.
  - Jing’an Park: assume **3,000–8,000 users/day** (walkers, office workers, community).
- **Schools / universities**  
  - No major university campus immediately adjacent; some primary/secondary schools within a broader radius but not key demand drivers for B2-level coffee in a fashion mall.
- **Hospitals**  
  - Large hospitals are not directly next door (main ones are further away), so they are **secondary** sources here.

## 4. Footfall & Customer Sources

### 4.1 Réel Mall Footfall (Mall-Level)

Direct published annual footfall numbers for **Réel Mall** are not readily found in open web search. However, benchmark comparisons help:

- Similar high-end, inner-ring Shanghai malls (e.g., Jing’an Kerry Centre, Plaza 66) often reach:
  - **25–40 million visits/year**, i.e. **~70,000–110,000 visits/day on average**.
- Réel Mall is slightly smaller but in the same node and directly integrated with Jing’an Temple Station.

**Conservative working assumption for Réel Mall:**

- **Average daily mall visitors**:  
  - Conservative: **45,000–60,000**  
  - Peak weekends/holidays: **80,000–100,000+**

### 4.2 How Many of These See B2?

Not all mall visitors go to B2:

- B2 in many Chinese malls often has:
  - F&B, supermarket, and metro-linked circulation.
- Given strong metro integration (Jing’an Temple station exits feeding into or adjacent to the mall), B2 likely sees a high share.

Conservative assumptions:

- **Share of total mall visitors passing through or near B2**:
  - Weekdays: **35–45%**  
  - Weekends: **45–55%**

Using the mall daily visitor assumption:

- **Weekday B2 passer-by volume**:  
  - 45,000 × 0.35 = **15,750** (low)  
  - 60,000 × 0.45 = **27,000** (high)
- **Weekend B2 passer-by volume**:  
  - 60,000 × 0.45 = **27,000** (low)  
  - 100,000 × 0.55 = **55,000** (high; peak days)

For planning, use a **working typical-day passer-by range at or near the shop** of:

- **B2 coffee-shop frontage exposure**: **15,000–30,000 people/day**  
  (This depends on exact corridor positioning within B2.)

### 4.3 Main Customer Source Categories

1. **Mall Shoppers (Local & Tourists)**  
   - Driven by West Nanjing Road “luxury corridor” reputation and Jing’an business district.  
   - Likely to have **middle-to-high disposable income** and spend on specialty coffee.
2. **Office Workers in 300–800 m radius**  
   - ~50,000–70,000 workers; coffee demand especially:
     - Morning commute
     - Lunchtime takeaway
     - Afternoon pick-me-up
3. **Metro Commuters (Jing’an Temple Station)**  
   - ~250,000–300,000 entries+exits per weekday (estimate).  
   - Only a fraction routes via Réel Mall and then via B2:
     - Assume 15–25% of these flows enter the mall perimeter; of that, 40–60% route via B2 corridors.
     - Effective B2 commuter flow: roughly **15,000–45,000/day** overlapping with mall counts (so must avoid double-counting).
4. **Tourists & Temple/Park Visitors**  
   - Jing’an Temple + Jing’an Park combined: **~6,000–14,000 visitors/day**.  
   - Share entering the mall: assume **20–35% → 1,200–4,900/day** potential visitors, many looking for rest and refreshments.
5. **Nearby Residents (800–1,500 m)**  
   - 39k residents (800 m), 184k (1.5 km).  
   - Realistic frequent-user subset (i.e., residents likely to visit this mall at least monthly): perhaps **20–30% of 800 m residents → 8,000–12,000 people**.  
   - Daily coffee shop visits from residents: a small but stable segment, especially evenings/weekends.

## 5. Customer Number Estimation for the Coffee Shop

This section estimates:

- **Deterministic reachable customer pool** (people regularly passing close enough to notice the shop).
- **Potential maximum customer count** (realistic upper bound of daily transactions for a single coffee shop in this location).

### 5.1 Deterministic Daily Passer-By Estimate

Combine overlapping sources without double-counting:

- **Base B2 corridor flow** (already integrating shoppers + some commuters + tourists):
  - Use **15,000–30,000/day** as the **deterministic passer-by range** who physically pass near the store frontage.
- Additional incremental groups not fully captured in B2 general flow, e.g.:
  - Some **office workers choosing B2 specifically for lunch/coffee** from nearby streets (entering via particular exits) – but these are largely counted among mall traffic.
  - To be conservative and avoid double-counting, keep deterministic passer-by as **15,000–30,000/day**.

So:

- **Deterministic daily potential exposure**:  
  **≈ 15,000 (low) – 30,000 (high) people/day** walking close enough to see the shop.

### 5.2 Conversion to Visitors & Transactions

For a coffee shop in a high-traffic mall corridor:

- Typical F&B corridor conversion from passer-by to **store visitors**:
  - **1–4%** (varies by brand, visibility, product appeal).
- Conversion from visitors to **actual paying customers**:
  - Usually **80–90%** for quick-service coffee.

Conservative scenario:

- Passer-by: **15,000/day**  
- 1.0% enter → 150 visitors/day  
- 85% purchase → **≈130 paying customers/day**

More optimistic but still realistic scenario:

- Passer-by: **30,000/day**  
- 2.5% enter → 750 visitors/day  
- 85% purchase → **≈640 paying customers/day**

Therefore, an evidence-based **typical operating range**:

- **Deterministic daily customer number (reasonable band)**:  
  **~130 – 640 paying customers/day**

### 5.3 Potential Maximum Volume

Under best conditions (weekends, holidays, strong brand, strong operations):

Assume:

- Higher B2 flow on peak days: **40,000–55,000 passer-by** in front of the store.
- Strong positioning, promotions, and repeat traffic from office workers and tourists.

If:

- 3.5–4.5% of passer-by enter, 90% purchase:

Example upper-bound calculation:

- 45,000 passer-by × 4.0% entry = 1,800 visitors  
- 90% purchase → **1,620 paying customers/day**

So a **potential maximum daily customer count**:

- **Realistic peak capacity target**: **~1,200 – 1,600 transactions/day**, assuming:
  - Adequate staffing and service speed
  - Sufficient seating/throughput
  - Strong product-market fit and brand draw

This is an **upper bound**, not a typical average.

## 6. Main Customer Sources – Quantified Summary

Approximate **daily person counts** who are realistically in the pool to become customers (before conversion):

1. **Réel Mall visitors**  
   - 45,000–60,000/day, of which 35–55% use B2 → **15,000–33,000 B2-level visitors/day**.
2. **Office workers (within 800 m)**  
   - 50,000–70,000 in total.  
   - Fraction entering Réel Mall on a given weekday: assume **8–12% → 4,000–8,000/day** (already partly counted as mall visitors).
3. **Metro commuters routing via mall/B2**  
   - 250,000–300,000 station entries+exits.  
   - 10–20% entering the mall; 40–60% of those via B2 → **10,000–36,000/day**, overlapping with B2 traffic above.
4. **Tourists / temple & park visitors entering mall**  
   - 6,000–14,000 temple+park visitors/day; 20–35% enter the mall → **1,200–4,900/day**, partly overlapping with general mall counts.
5. **Nearby residents using Réel Mall**  
   - Out of 39k residents (800 m), assume ~10–15% visit the mall daily on average (including repeat visits): **4,000–6,000/day**, mostly folded into mall visitor total.

Because these are overlapping, the **joint, non-duplicated exposure** is captured reasonably by the **15,000–30,000 B2 passer-by** figure.

## 7. Pros & Cons of the Location (Customer Perspective)

### Pros

- **High, diversified people flow**:
  - Strong combination of office workers, high-income shoppers, metro commuters, and tourists.
  - Deterministic corridor flow of **15,000–30,000 people/day** near the shop.
- **Affluent customer base**:
  - West Nanjing Road is described as “Shanghai’s most costly fashion commercial block with premium brands for wealthy consumers”; supports **higher price per cup**.
- **Year-round demand drivers**:
  - Offices → weekday breakfast and afternoon coffee.
  - Shopping & tourism → weekends, holidays, evenings.
  - Residents → off-peak and repeat usage.
- **Weather-proof traffic**:
  - Indoor B2 mall location and metro integration reduce seasonality and weather impact.

### Cons

- **Low street visibility**:
  - Being on **B2** means zero direct street frontage; reliance on **signage, wayfinding, and mall marketing**.
- **Intense competition**:
  - High probability of multiple coffee and beverage brands within Réel Mall and surrounding malls; share of wallet and attention is contested.
- **High occupancy and operating costs**:
  - West Nanjing Road ranks among Shanghai’s highest retail rents; profitability requires either:
    - Higher volumes (approaching upper end of estimated daily transactions), or
    - Premium pricing and high average ticket size.
- **Flow concentration & time peaks**:
  - Very strong peaks at:
    - Morning commute (7:30–9:30)
    - Lunch (11:30–13:30)
    - Afternoon (15:00–18:00)
  - Weaker late-night traffic; staffing needs to match peaks to avoid lost sales.

## 8. Overall Assessment

- **Deterministic customer exposure**:  
  - B2 passer-by: **≈15,000–30,000/day** around the store.
- **Deterministic daily transaction band** (under typical operations and conservative-to-moderate conversion):
  - **≈130 – 640 paying customers/day**.
- **Potential maximum daily transaction capacity** with strong execution on a busy day:
  - **≈1,200 – 1,600 customers/day**.

In summary, this location in Réel Mall B2 at Jing’an Temple offers **substantial and diversified customer potential** driven by mall footfall, metro interchange, nearby offices, and tourist inflows. The main challenges are intense competition, high rent, and reliance on internal mall traffic rather than street visibility; success will depend on effective differentiation and maximising conversion from the large but competitive passer-by base.
