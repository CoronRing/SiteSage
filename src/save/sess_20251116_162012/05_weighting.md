#### Weights
- **Customer:** 0.3
- **Traffic:** 0.5
- **Competition:** 0.2

#### Justification
The Coffee Shop benefits from its location within an airport, an environment characterized by a high flow of foot traffic which is supported by its proximity to numerous public transit stops. The presence of frequent travelers elevates the importance of traffic significantly. While there is a substantial local customer base, the intense competition dilutes its value. Despite the proximity of numerous competitors, the convenience provided by the shop's location is expected to be a key strength, thus reducing the negative impact of high competition.
