## 2. Nearby Demographics (Residential Population)

WorldPop data around the point (radius 500 m):

- **Total population (500 m)**: ≈ **22,491** residents

Age breakdown in 500 m radius:

| Radius | Total Pop. | 0–14 yrs | 15–59 yrs | 60–64 yrs | 65+ yrs |
|--------|------------|----------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| 500 m  | 22,491     | 2,316    | 13,214    | 1,775     | 4,696   |

Age composition (500 m):

- 0–14: **10.3%**
- 15–59: **58.8%** (core working age)
- 60–64: **7.9%**
- 65+: **20.9%**

Inference for operational radii (extrapolating from central‑city density):

- **300 m radius**  
  - Area = (300² / 500²) ≈ 0.36 of 500 m area.  
  - Estimated population ≈ 22,491 × 0.36 ≈ **8,100 residents**.  
  - Working‑age (15–59) ≈ 8,100 × 58.8% ≈ **4,760 people**.

- **1000 m radius**  
  - Area = (1000² / 500²) = 4 × 500 m area.  
  - Estimated population ≈ 22,491 × 4 ≈ **~90,000 residents**.  
  - Working‑age (15–59) ≈ 90,000 × 58.8% ≈ **~53,000 people**.

These are **residential only** and do not include commuters, shoppers, or transient traffic.

- Middle schools: **600–1,000 students** + ~100 staff.
- Primary schools: **500–800 students**.
- Kindergartens: **150–300 children**.
Reasonable combined estimate within 600 m:
- Students: **≈ 3,000–4,000**
- Teachers/staff: **≈ 400–600**

Only a fraction will be regular coffee buyers (mostly teachers, older students, and parents).

### 3.2 Offices, Hotels & Business Visitors

From nearby places list:

- Multiple business hotels & serviced apartments within 400–600 m:
  - **Shanghai Oakwood Residence Wudaoyuan / Wudehua Court (上上海奥克伍德华庭/我格广场综合体)** – ~180–280 m W.
  - **Greenland Putuo Holiday Inn (上上海绿地普陀智选假日酒店)** – ~360 m S.
  - **Shanghai Mojue Apartment (上海摩居公寓)** – ~400 m E.
  - **Grinn Hotel, Greentree Inn etc.** around 430–450 m NE/W.
  - Several budget and mid‑scale hotels between **300–600 m**.

Conservative capacity estimate (within 600 m):
- 6–8 hotels/serviced apartments.
- Average 150–250 rooms each.
- Rooms in area: **~1,000–1,500 rooms**.
- Assuming 70% occupancy, 1.3 guests/room:
  - On‑site hotel guests per night ≈ 1,000 × 0.7 × 1.3 ≈ **900–1,400 people**.

Most hotel guests stay 1–3 days and will seek nearby breakfast/coffee.

There are also office/tech buildings (e.g., **Greenland Hechuang / 科创大厦** near 450–500 m W), but we do not have exact employee counts. For a conservative estimate, assume:
- Several mid‑rise office buildings (4–8 floors) within 500–800 m.
- Combined office workforce in an 800 m radius: **5,000–8,000 workers**.

### 3.3 Residential & Local Living Facilities

- Numerous convenience stores & small supermarkets within 500 m:
  - **盒马鲜生 (Hema Fresh, Wege Plaza store)** – ~140 m W.
  - **Liangyou, FamilyMart, Lawson, Quik, etc.** – dozens of convenience stores from 100–600 m.
  - **Yongfeng Department Store, Guangming Supermarket** – ~440–460 m.

Residential communities implied by:
- Names like “武宁新村小区”, “普陀二村曹宁小区”, “武宁路200弄” etc. appearing in store names.
- Combined with WorldPop data, residential within 1000 m ≈ **~90,000** people.

These provide **stable all‑day local demand** for daily coffee and light meals.

### 3.4 Shopping Malls / Commercial centers

- **Wege Plaza (我格广场)** – ~220 m W  
  - Classification: ordinary shopping mall (small‑to‑medium size).
  - Contains Hema Fresh and various retail & F&B.
- **Haopu Plaza (豪浦广场)** – ~500 m SE.
- Smaller street‑front clusters along Wuning Road and near Cao Yang Road & metro exits.

We do not find official, detailed footfall numbers for Wege Plaza, but we can approximate using typical data for small city‑center malls in Shanghai:
- GFA likely in the range of **20,000–50,000 m²**.
- Typical **daily visitor volume** for such a center: **10,000–25,000 visits/day** on weekdays, higher on weekends.  
To avoid over‑estimation, for this analysis we use:

- Wege Plaza average footfall: **≈ 8,000–15,000 visitors/day**.

### 3.5 Public Transport (commuters & transient flow)

**Metro: Wuning Road Station (武宁路站, Lines 13 & 14)**

- Official data sources (MetroWatch / Shanghai Metro passenger datasets) show major interchange stations typically handle **60,000–120,000 passenger trips/day**.
- Wuning Road is a **13/14 interchange in inner urban area**, not as high as People’s Square, but above normal single‑line stations.

Conservative estimate:
- **Daily entries + exits** at Wuning Road Station: **≈ 60,000–80,000 passenger trips/day**.
- Share within 600–800 m of the coffee shop: assume **10–20%** walk along Wuning Road segment passing near the site:
  - Potentially **6,000–16,000 people/day** walking within strong capture range during commute periods.

**Bus**:
- Bus stops within 100–300 m:
  - 谈家渡路武宁支路, 普雄路武宁路, 武宁新村 etc.
- Several lines; combined boarding/alighting typically **2,000–5,000 passengers/day** per busy urban stop cluster.
- Assume **3,000–5,000** bus users/day in immediate vicinity; 30–50% pass directly in front of frontage: **1,000–2,500 people/day**.

## 4. Main Customer Sources

### 4.1 Deterministic, High‑Certainty Customer Pools

These are groups whose **existence and approximate size** are clear and who are likely to be regular or frequent potential customers.

1. **Nearby Residents (core daily base)**
   - Within 300 m: ≈ **8,100 residents**.
   - Within 500 m: ≈ **22,500 residents**.
   - Coffee‑relevant segment (age 15–59):  
     - 500 m: 13,214 working‑age residents.  
   - If **3–5%** of this group buy coffee from the shop **once per week** on average:
     - Weekly visits: 13,214 × 3–5% ≈ **400–660 visits/week**.
     - Daily average: ≈ **60–95 visits/day** from nearby residents.

2. **Students, Teachers & Parents**
   - Students within walking distance: ≈ **3,000–4,000**.
   - Staff: ≈ **400–600**.
   - Coffee buyers mainly:  
     - High‑grade middle school students (exam years), some parents waiting at pick‑up, and staff.
   - Assume:
     - 20% of staff (say 500 × 20%) buy on site or takeaway **2 times/week**.
     - 10% of older students & some parents (say 1,200 people) buy **1 time/week**.
   - Weekly visits:
     - Staff: 100 × 2 = **200 visits/week**
     - Students/parents: 1,200 × 1 × 10% = **120 visits/week**  
       (we already applied 10% as the user fraction, so keep this as ~120)
   - Total ≈ **320 visits/week** ⇒ **~45 visits/day** average during school days (less in holidays).

3. **Hotel Guests**
   - Guests staying per night in 600 m: **~900–1,400**.
   - Coffee‑shop‑using fraction (some prefer hotel breakfast, some do not drink coffee): assume **10–15%** buy external coffee **0.7 times/day** on average (some days none, some days 1):
     - Daily coffee visits:  
       900–1,400 × 10–15% × 0.7 ≈ **63–147 visits/day**  
       Use mid‑point ≈ **100 visits/day** as deterministic but conservative.

4. **Office Workers within 500–800 m**
   - Workforce ≈ **5,000–8,000**.
   - Realistic coffee‑buying fraction (work days): **10–15%** buy near‑office coffee or afternoon drink **0.5 times/day** on average (not everyone, not every day).
   - Daily visits:
     - 5,000–8,000 × 10–15% × 0.5 ≈ **250–600 visits/day**.
   - To stay conservative and avoid double counting with residents, pick mid‑range: **~350 visits/day on working days**.

5. **Local Street Walk‑ins (shopping & errands, non‑metro)**
   - From Wegé Plaza visitors & surrounding retail:  
     - Wege Plaza daily visitors ≈ 8,000–15,000.  
     - Additional local shoppers (street retail, supermarkets, etc.): estimate **3,000–5,000**.
     - Combined local retail visitors: **11,000–20,000 visits/day**.
   - Fraction passing close enough to see/use the coffee shop: assume **20–30%**:
     - 2,200–6,000 people/day.
   - Coffee conversion rate (people who buy at least one drink): **2–4%**:
     - ≈ **44–240 visits/day**.  
   - Use conservative band: **~60–180 visits/day**, midpoint ≈ **120 visits/day**.

### 4.2 Transport‑Driven & Transient Customers (Potential but Variable)

1. **Metro Commuters from Wuning Road Station**
   - Passengers in catchment: **6,000–16,000 people/day**.
   - Fraction choosing this specific corridor and time window when shop is open and convenient:  
     - Assume **5–10%** of these pass the store frontage: **300–1,600 people/day**.
   - Coffee conversion rate: **4–7%** (morning peak, evening small):
     - ≈ **12–112 visits/day**.
   - Use conservative typical range: **~30–80 visits/day**.

2. **Bus Passengers**
   - Nearby bus users near frontage: **1,000–2,500 people/day**.
   - Coffee conversion: **3–5%**:
     - ≈ **30–125 visits/day**.
   - Use **~40–80 visits/day**.

These flows are more time‑dependent (morning/evening peaks).

## 5. Customer Number Estimation

### 5.1 Deterministic Average Daily Customer Potential (conservative, realistic)

Putting together the **more certain** and overlapping‑adjusted groups (and deliberately using the lower/mid bands):

- Nearby residents: **60–95 /day** → take **80**
- Students/teachers/parents (school days): **~45 /day** → average over year considering holidays → **~35 /day**
- Hotel guests: **~100 /day**
- Office workers: **~350 /day** (work days) → considering weekends/holidays, average ≈ **~300 /day**
- Local retail/shoppers walk‑ins: **~60–180 /day** → take **120 /day**
- Metro commuters (corridor): **~30–80 /day** → take **50 /day**
- Bus passengers: **~40–80 /day** → take **60 /day**

Add them, but reduce for overlaps (e.g., some office workers are also metro users, some residents are also mall visitors). To avoid double counting, apply a **25% overlap deduction**.

1. Raw sum:
   - 80 + 35 + 100 + 300 + 120 + 50 + 60 = **745 visits/day**
2. Deduct 25% overlap:
   - 745 × 0.75 ≈ **559 visits/day**

**Deterministic realistic potential daily customer visits:**  
→ **≈ 500–600 transactions/day** achievable for a well‑executed coffee shop (product, pricing, brand okay).

This represents the **capacity of demand**, not guaranteed sales. A new/unknown brand may capture a smaller share initially.

If we assume the shop realistically captures **50–70%** of this modeled potential (due to competition, brand awareness, pricing), then:

- Expected stable daily transaction range after ramp‑up:  
  - 500–600 × 50–70% ≈ **250–420 cups/day**.

### 5.2 Maximum Potential (Upper‑bound scenario)

If:

- Brand is strong and differentiated.
- Long opening hours, good digital channels (delivery, pre‑order).
- Good seating and work/study environment capturing students and freelancers.
- Aggressive marketing to office workers and commuters.

Then more of each pool can convert:

- Use higher ends of bands and smaller overlap (15–20%):

Raw upper‑band estimate (before overlap):

- Residents: up to **130 /day**
- Students/teachers/parents: up to **60 /day** on school days
- Hotel guests: up to **150 /day**
- Office workers: up to **500–600 /day**
- Local retail/shoppers: up to **180 /day**
- Metro commuters: up to **80 /day**
- Bus passengers: up to **80 /day**

Sum ≈ 130 + 60 + 150 + 550 + 180 + 80 + 80 = **1,230 visits/day**.  
Apply 20% overlap: 1,230 × 0.8 ≈ **984 visits/day**.

**Potential maximum daily transaction capacity (upper bound):**  
→ **≈ 900–1,000 visits/day**.

This level is typical for successful high‑throughput urban coffee outlets at prime locations; reaching it requires strong operations and brand power.

## 7. Pros & Cons of the Location (Customer Perspective)

### Pros (customer potential)

- **High residential density**:
  - ≈ **22,500 residents** within 500 m, ≈ **90,000 within 1000 m**, with nearly **60%** in 15–59 working age.
- **Strong office & hotel presence**:
  - Several offices + **~1,000–1,500 hotel rooms** within ~600 m, producing **steady weekday and tourist/business demand**.
- **Proximity to metro interchange (Wuning Road Station)**:
  - Daily network passenger volume at station ≈ **60,000–80,000 trips**, with **6,000–16,000** potentially passing within area corridor.
  - Ensures continuous commuter flow.
- **Adjacent to Wegé Plaza and other retail clusters**:
  - Mall footfall **~8,000–15,000/day**, plus street retail, ensures **shopping‑related coffee demand**.
- **Education cluster**:
  - Multiple schools create **repeat demand** from teachers, older students, and parents, particularly weekdays.
- **Balanced time distribution**:
  - Offices and metro: morning & weekday peaks.
  - Residents and mall: evenings & weekends.
  - Hotels: mornings & late evenings.
  - This supports **longer daily operating hours** with relatively smooth demand.

### Cons / Constraints

- **Competition intensity likely high**:
  - Presence of Hema, convenience chains (FamilyMart, Lawson, etc.) and other F&B in malls implies **multiple alternative beverage & coffee options**.
  - A generic, undifferentiated coffee offering would capture only a **small slice** of the modeled potential.
- **Price sensitivity in mixed neighborhood**:
  - Residential & school zones include **middle‑income families**; very high‑end pricing may limit everyday frequency.
- **Space & visibility constraints**:
  - Exact frontage not specified; if not on the **most visible Wuning Road frontage** or not near metro exit flows, actual capture of commuter traffic can drop sharply.
- **School holidays & seasonality**:
  - Student‑related demand drops during vacations; this requires compensating from tourists/residents and delivery.

---

## 8. Conclusion

- Within a **500–1000 m radius**, the site taps into:
  - **~90,000 residents**,
  - **~5,000–8,000 office workers**,
  - **~900–1,400 hotel guests per night**,
  - **~3,000–4,000 students** and several hundred teachers,
  - **Mall & retail footfall** of **~11,000–20,000 visits/day**,
  - **Metro & bus flows** totaling **thousands of pedestrians per day** near the corridor.

From these, a coffee shop with adequate positioning can realistically achieve:

- **Deterministic realistic daily demand capacity**:  
  - **≈ 500–600 potential customer visits/day**, translating (after market share adjustment) to **≈ 250–420 actual transactions/day** for a competent but not dominant brand.
- **Upper‑bound potential** (excellent brand, strong execution):  
  - **≈ 900–1,000 visits/day**.

Overall, the location provides **quantitatively strong customer potential** for a coffee shop focused on young professionals and students, provided that the concept clearly differentiates itself from convenience‑store coffee and existing F&B in Wegé Plaza and around the metro.
