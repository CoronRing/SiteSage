## Public transit availability

**Key finding:** The store sits directly on Wuning Road (武宁路), within a dense bus and metro catchment. Distances below are walking distances from the store coordinates (31.237001, 121.425183).

### Metro

There are **two metro corridors within ~600–700 m**:

1. **Cao Yang Road Station (曹杨路站)** – Line 3 / 4 / 11 (multi‑line hub)  
   - Nearest exits around 300–650 m from the store:
     - Exit 9: 31.23947, 121.423345 – **≈325 m**
     - Exit 8: 31.238556, 121.422724 – **≈290 m**
     - Exit 10/11/12/13: 413–608 m  
   - This is a heavy‑usage interchange; typical trip volume for such a node in inner Shanghai is in the range of **150,000–250,000 passenger trips/day**.  
   - Based on the previous customer report: **6,000–16,000 passengers/day** are estimated to walk along the corridor passing near the shop.

2. **Wuning Road Station (武宁路站)** – Line 13 & 14  
   - Station body ≈550–600 m east of the store:
     - Exit 1: 31.234174, 121.429866 – **≈545 m**
     - Exits 2–3: 586–692 m  
   - Prior report estimated **60,000–80,000 passenger trips/day**, with **several thousand** walking in the direction of the shop.

3. **Longde Road Station (隆德路站)** – Line 11 / 13  
   - Exit 1: 31.231045, 121.423200 – **≈690 m**  
   - Full station ≈700–750 m away; contributes additional through‑traffic and transfers but is secondary vs Cao Yang / Wuning for this site.

**Implication for a coffee shop targeting young professionals and students:**

- Within **800 m** (≈10 min walk), the store is inside the overlapping influence of **5 metro lines (3, 4, 11, 13, 14)** at 3 stations.
- Realistic daily *potential passer‑by pool from metro* within the walking/visual corridor:  
  - From earlier report + this geometry: **7,000–18,000 persons/day**.

### Bus

Within **900 m radius**, at least **10+ bus stops**:

Closest stops (≤250 m):

- **谈家渡路武宁支路 (bus stop)** – 31.236124, 121.424863 – **≈100 m**

Further key stops (within 700 m):

- **曹杨路谈家渡路**, **长寿路武宁路**, **中山北路陆家宅**, **东新路光复西路**, etc. (distances ≈540–750 m)

From the previous analysis and the density of stops:

- Estimated **3,000–5,000 bus boardings/alightings/day** in the immediate area.
- Conservative estimate **1,000–2,500 people/day** pass close enough to see or easily detour to the shop.

**Transit summary:**  
Within **5–8 minutes’ walk**, the store is accessible from:

- 5 metro lines at 3 stations.
- At least 3 bus stops within 250 m, plus multiple secondary stops to 700 m.

## Parking availability

The nearby‑places result did not directly list structured parking as “parking lot,” but we can infer from land uses:

- **On‑street / curb parking along side streets**:  
  - Side streets like 普雄路、谈家渡路 and small residential lanes (e.g., 普雄馨苑、东沙小区周边) usually provide a mix of:
    - Short‑term curb parking
    - Informal motorcycle/e‑bike parking  
  - Practical capacity within 200–300 m: **dozens of car spaces** and **tens to >100 two‑wheeler spots**.

- **Commercial parking in nearby 我格广场 (IMAGO 我格广场)** – ≈160–200 m west:  
  - A modern mall of this size typically offers **100–300 underground parking spaces**.  
  - Customers using the mall can walk **2–4 minutes** to the coffee shop location.

- **Residential compound parking** (普雄馨苑, 东沙小区, 武宁新村等):  
  - These provide residents’ parking, not public, but practically some ride‑hailing drop‑off and temporary stops occur at the gates along Wuning Road.

**Parking implication:**

- For **car drivers**, there is **no large open public lot directly at the door**, but:
  - Mall parking at 我格广场 within **2–4 minutes’ walk**.
  - Short‑term roadside availability in side streets.
- For **e‑bikes / scooters**, typical Shanghai pattern suggests:

  - Easy parking on sidewalks or at compound gates within **0–100 m** of the frontage, supporting takeaway and delivery.

---

## Customer flow analysis

Based on the previous customer report plus this transport geometry, we can specify **origin–destination paths** and where the store lies relative to them.

### 1. Young professionals (office workers)

- **Origins:**  
  - Metro (Cao Yang Road / Wuning Road / Longde Road).
  - Residential compounds within 500–1000 m (≈90,000 residents in 1 km).
- **Destinations:**  
  - Offices and commercial buildings along 武宁路, 普雄路, near 我格广场, 豪浦广场, and around each metro station.
- **Typical routes:**
  - Metro → walk along 武宁路 or cross‑streets to office.  
  - Bus → get off at 武宁新村 / 谈家渡路武宁支路 → walk 100–400 m to workplaces or home.
- **Store position:**
  - The shop is **on the arterial itself**, about **150–200 m east of 我格广场**, between:
    - Metro Cao Yang Road / residential to the west.
    - Metro Wuning Road / mid‑high‑rise offices/commercial to the east.
  - Thus it sits in the **natural walking line** for:
    - People exiting Cao Yang Road Station walking east along 武宁路.
    - Residents from north/south blocks walking toward 我格广场 and bus stops.

### 2. Students (middle/high school & university‑related)

Nearby education (from prior context and map):

- 上海音乐学院附属实验中学、武宁路小学、同济二附中等 within ≈600–900 m.
- Combined **≈3,000–4,000 students** + **≈400–600 staff**.

Flows:

- **Morning:**  
  - Students from nearby compounds walk or take bus, often using Wuning Road crossings near schools.
  - The shop can capture **before‑school** takeaway (especially older students + teachers) if opening by 7:00–7:30.
- **Afternoon / early evening:**  
  - Students after class:
    - Going home (walk or bus).
    - Going to 我格广场, milk‑tea shops, training institutions.
  - A share of this flow passes within **3–6 minutes’ walk** of the site.

Given strong competition near 我格广场 (Costa, CHAGEE, etc.), the positioning is:

- **Less directly inside the student cluster** than the mall itself.
- More convenient for students who live east/south of the site or bus to that direction.

### 3. Residents

Based on previous demographics:

- **Within 500 m:** ≈22,491 residents.
- **Within 1,000 m:** ≈90,000 residents.

Flows:

- **Daily life:** walking to:
  - 我格广场 & 豪浦广场 (food, retail).
  - Metro stations and bus stops.
  - Schools and clinics.
- Many of these flows must use:
  - 武宁路 sidewalk in front of the store.
  - Crossings at 普雄路 / 谈家渡路 / 武宁新村.

For residents within **300–600 m**, the store lies on:

- Their regular **east–west walking spine** (to malls and offices).
- Their **bus/metro access route**.

### 4. Hotel guests & business travelers

Previous analysis estimated **1,000–1,500 hotel/serviced apartment rooms**, giving roughly **900–1,400 guests/night**.

Flows:

- Hotel → metro (Cao Yang Road or Wuning Road) along 武宁路.
- Hotel → 我格广场 for dining and shopping.

The shop, located **between** some hotels and the metro/mall nodes, can capture:

- **Morning coffee** before they board metro.
- **Evening “wind‑down” drink** returning to hotels.

Estimated daily potential passing near the shop: **300–600 hotel guests/day** along Wuning Road segments.

### 5. Commuters via bus

From bus boarding/alighting estimates:

- **1,000–2,500 bus users/day** pass close to the frontage (≤250 m).
- Many are:
  - Workers commuting between north–south neighborhoods and metro hubs.
  - Residents connecting to distant workplaces.

The coffee shop can serve:

- **Quick grab‑and‑go** for those switching from walking to bus (or vice versa) if queue and service times stay under **2–3 minutes**.

## Detour estimation

To visualize detours, here is a static map centered at the coffee shop:

![Static map – site and surroundings](https://restapi.amap.com/v3/staticmap?location=121.425183%2C31.237001&zoom=15&size=512%2A512&markers=mid%2C%2CA%3A121.425183%2C31.237001&key=68913ce8db83f7bbe5b4cca9720c7a8f)

### Reference walking speeds

- Average urban walking speed: **1.2–1.4 m/s**  
  → **72–84 m/min**  
- Use **80 m/min** as working value.

Thus:

- **5‑minute detour radius (round‑trip)** ≈ 5 min × 80 m/min = **400 m** of extra walking total (≈200 m each way).
- **10‑minute detour radius (round‑trip)** ≈ **800 m** extra walking total (≈400 m each way).

“Detour” here means **extra** beyond their normal path.

### 1. Metro users

a) **Cao Yang Road Station → offices / homes east along Wuning Road**

- Straight‑line path already passes **within 50–150 m** of the store.
- Extra detour to step into the shop and back to their path:
  - **Horizontal offset:** ≈10–50 m from curb to shop entrance.
  - **Extra walking distance:** ≈20–100 m.
  - **Extra time:** **0.25–1.25 minutes**.
- So nearly **all east‑bound metro commuters from Cao Yang Road to this corridor** are within **<5‑minute detour**, effectively **no meaningful detour**.

b) **Wuning Road Station → homes/offices west along Wuning Road**

- Distance from Wuning Road Station to the store: ≈550–600 m.
- Passengers whose **destination is west of the station** may:

  - Walk directly along Wuning Road and pass the shop naturally.
  - Or slightly divert (20–50 m) off their route to enter.

- Additional detour distance: **≤100 m** → **≤1.25 minutes**.

c) **Longde Road Station**

- Farther (≈700 m); most flows likely choose local options near Longde Road or 我格广场.

**Metro detour population:**

From earlier: **7,000–18,000 relevant metro pedestrians/day** in the corridor.

- Those with **≤5‑minute detour**:  
  - People whose natural path runs on or along 武宁路 between Cao Yang and Wuning Road stations.  
  - Estimated share: **60–80%**, thus **≈4,000–14,000/day**.
- Those with **≤10‑minute detour** but not in ≤5‑minute:  
  - People working/learning slightly off‑corridor (inside compounds or side streets up to 400 m offset).  
  - Additional **1,000–3,000/day**.

### 2. Bus users

Closest stops within **≈100–250 m**:

- If their route from bus stop to home/office already passes the frontage, detour is **0–50 m**.
- If they must walk an extra block:
  - Typical side‑street block length: **80–150 m**.
  - Extra round‑trip: **160–300 m** → **2–4 minutes**.

**Estimates:**

- Bus users with **≤5‑minute detour**:  
  - Mostly from **谈家渡路武宁支路、普雄路武宁路、武宁新村**.  
  - Share ≈ **70–80%** of 1,000–2,500 bus users near the site → **≈700–2,000 persons/day**.
- With **≤10‑minute detour**: near **100%**, up to **2,500/day**.

### 3. Nearby residents

Within **radius R from the store** (not detour, just straight line):

- R = **400 m** (≈5‑minute one‑way walk)  
  - Coverage includes: 武宁路沿线两侧住宅、普雄馨苑、东沙小区、部分武宁新村等。  
  - In dense Putuo, inner‑ring densities often exceed **35,000–40,000 people/km²**.  
  - Area of circle radius 0.4 km = π × (0.4)² ≈ 0.50 km².  
  - Estimated residents within 400 m ≈ **17,000–20,000 people**.
- R = **800 m** (≈10‑minute one‑way walk)  
  - Area ≈ 2.0 km².
  - Reported 1 km radius (3.14 km²) population ≈90,000 → ≈28,700/km².  
  - So within 800 m: ≈ 28,700 × 2.0 = **≈57,000 residents**.

If we interpret detour relative to their *existing route* (e.g., going to metro or mall) rather than home:

- Many residents’ daily movements already pass along Wuning Road or its nearest parallels.
- Conservatively:

  - **Residents within 5‑minute detour of their daily path:** **10,000–15,000 individuals** have at least one daily route where adding the shop costs **≤5 minutes**.
  - **Within 10‑minute detour:** **25,000–40,000 individuals**.

### 4. Young professionals & students specifically

Focusing on the **target groups**:

- **Students + staff**: 3,000–4,000 students and 400–600 staff.
  - Those whose home or key transit route uses Wuning Road in this segment:
    - Within **≤5‑minute detour:** **≈1,500–2,500 people/day**.
    - Within **≤10‑minute detour:** **≈2,500–3,500 people/day**.
- **Young professionals (white/blue collar within walking radius):**

  - From previous report: **5,000–8,000 office workers** nearby.
  - Likely **60–70%** of them transit across Wuning Road or associated metro/bus.  
  - Within **≤5‑minute detour:**  
    - 0.6 × 5,000 to 0.7 × 8,000 → **≈3,000–5,600 workers**.
  - Within **≤10‑minute detour:**  
    - Nearly all → **≈5,000–8,000 workers**.

Summarising **5 / 10‑minute detour pools for target customers** (approximate, after overlap):

- **≤5‑minute detour:**  
  - Young professionals: **3,000–5,000**  
  - Students + staff: **1,500–2,500**  
  - Total: **≈4,500–7,500 people**.
- **≤10‑minute detour:**  
  - Young professionals: **5,000–8,000**  
  - Students + staff: **2,500–3,500**  
  - Total: **≈7,500–11,500 people**.

These are *potential daily users* of the corridor, not coffee buyers; prior report’s **250–420 transactions/day** as realistic capture already incorporates conversion.

## Visibility analysis

### Street‑level visibility

- The address “武宁路 288 号附近” places the store:
  - Directly on **Wuning Road**, an **east–west arterial** with high traffic volumes (both cars and pedestrians).
  - Between key intersections:
    - **Wuning Road × 普雄路** (to the west, near 我格广场).
    - **Wuning Road × 谈家渡路** (to the east).
- Nearby bus stops within 100–250 m (谈家渡路武宁支路、武宁新村) ensure:
  - Passengers waiting at stops will have sightlines to **shopfronts along Wuning Road**.
- If the coffee shop is ground‑floor with standard signage on this frontage:

  - **Vehicle visibility:** thousands of vehicles/day pass, but coffee conversion from car traffic is limited without easy stopping.
  - **Pedestrian visibility:**  
    - Most of the **4,000–14,000 metro corridor pedestrians/day** and **700–2,000 bus‑area pedestrians/day** are likely to have **direct line of sight** to the storefront if they walk along the same side or opposite side of Wuning.

### Relation to malls and competition

- **IMAGO 我格广场** at ≈160–200 m west:
  - Has well‑known brands (Costa, CHAGEE, etc.) that act as **strong magnets**.
  - Many people heading to the mall from east will pass **in front of** the store.
- However, **inside the mall**:

  - Footfall shifts indoors; visibility there is dominated by internal tenants.
  - The coffee shop on the street has **no visibility inside the mall**; instead it competes by:
    - Being **closer to transit stops** for quick takeaways.
    - Offering **faster in‑and‑out** vs going into the mall.

### Intersection vs mid‑block

- The exact coordinates are **slightly mid‑block**, not at a large cross intersection itself:
  - Approx. **80–150 m** from the closest major intersection.
- This implies:

  - Slightly lower **cross‑intersection attention** vs being on the corner.
  - Yet still strong **linear visibility** along the main carriageway.

---

## Summary: Pros & Cons in terms of traffic

### Pros

- **High public transit access:**
  - Within 800 m of:
    - 3 metro stations (Cao Yang Road, Wuning Road, Longde Road).
    - 5 lines (3, 4, 11, 13, 14).
  - **7,000–18,000 metro pedestrians/day** potentially in the corridor.
  - **1,000–2,500 bus users/day** near the frontage.

- **Large 5–10‑minute detour pool for target customers:**
  - Young professionals within ≤5‑minute detour: **3,000–5,000**; within ≤10‑minute: **5,000–8,000**.
  - Students + staff within ≤5‑minute: **1,500–2,500**; within ≤10‑minute: **2,500–3,500**.
  - Residential base within 400 m: **≈17,000–20,000 residents**; within 800 m: **≈57,000 residents**.

- **Strong street visibility on an arterial:**
  - Directly on Wuning Road, with:
    - Continuous pedestrian flows along the sidewalks.
    - Clear visibility from nearby bus stops and from people walking between metro stations and 我格广场.

- **Natural integration into daily routes:**
  - For many metro/bus commuters and nearby residents, **extra detour ≤1–3 minutes**.
  - Morning and evening commuter flows align well with coffee demand peaks.

- **Synergy with nearby commercial nodes:**
  - Close to 我格广场 and other retail/office clusters, capturing:
    - “Pre‑mall” and “post‑mall” coffee.
    - Office workers moving between stations and office towers.

### Cons

- **Strong competition nearby:**
  - Established coffee and tea brands (Costa Coffee, CHAGEE, bakery‑cafés, etc.) in 我格广场 ≈160–200 m away.
  - Competing offers for **exactly the same traffic** (office workers, students, shoppers).

- **Not located inside the main mall:**
  - Does not share **indoor mall footfall**; must rely on:
    - Street‑side passing traffic.
    - Differentiated positioning (e.g., quieter study/work environment vs mall hustle).

- **Car access not dominant:**
  - No large dedicated parking at the front; car users need:
    - Mall parking (≈2–4 minutes’ walk).
    - Side‑street curb parking.
  - This limits heavy car‑based coffee occasions vs drive‑through formats.

- **Mid‑block, not on a corner:**
  - Slightly reduced “all‑angle” visibility compared to a major intersection corner.
  - Reliance on good signage, lighting, and frontage design to stand out along a visually busy arterial.

---

### Overall traffic suitability conclusion

- The location offers:

  - **Excellent transit‑oriented access**, with dense metro and bus flows.
  - **Large young professional and student populations** in realistic 5–10‑minute detour range.
  - A **high‑exposure Wuning Road frontage**, which aligns well with a coffee shop focusing on everyday use, commuting, work, and study.

- Based on the quantified flows and previous demand modelling (≈250–420 transactions/day realistic, up to ≈900–1,000/day upper bound with optimal execution), the traffic fundamentals support a **strong potential** coffee shop, on the condition that:

  - The concept clearly differentiates from competitors around 我格广场 (e.g., better work/study space, consistent quality, convenient ordering).
  - The storefront has **strong visual identity** from both directions along Wuning Road.
  - Service speed is optimised to leverage the **short detour window** of commuters and students.
