# Weighting Rationale

- **Store type & concept**
  - Coffee shop / café focused on everyday use, with strong work and study use cases.
  - Serves both dine-in (lingering for work/study) and takeaway customers.

- **Customer (0.33)**
  - Targets **young professionals and students**, so local demographics (age, student population, employment centers) are important.
  - Repeat visits and habitual use (daily/weekly) make having a dense base of the right segments critical.
  - Aligned with rubric: coffee shops typically get a moderate customer weight (0.30–0.33); targeting students and young professionals justifies the upper end of that range.

- **Traffic & Accessibility (0.37)**
  - High visit frequency and convenience are central: customers come before/after classes, during breaks, and around work hours.
  - Needs strong **foot traffic** and/or easy access from campuses, offices, transit stops, and walkable neighborhoods.
  - Study/work positioning still benefits from visibility and ease of access for spontaneous visits.
  - Fits rubric guidance for coffee shops: traffic is the most critical factor (recommended 0.35–0.40), so 0.37 reflects that priority.

- **Competition (0.30)**
  - Coffee is a competitive category, but this concept can differentiate via **workspace quality, ambiance, seating, outlets, and Wi‑Fi**, not just beverage offering.
  - Students and young professionals may show some loyalty once they find a comfortable place to work/study.
  - Competition remains important but is slightly less decisive than having the right customers and strong accessibility, consistent with rubric ranges (0.30–0.35) for coffee shops.

- **Overall balance**
  - Weights sum to 1.0 and follow coffee shop norms: **Traffic > Customer ≥ Competition**.
  - Reflects a model where frequent, convenient access for a clearly defined but not ultra-niche segment is the main success driver, with competition relevant but not dominant.
