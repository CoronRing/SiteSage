# Evaluation Scores

## Customer Analysis: 7.9/10
The report supports a strong but not absolute-prime customer potential score. From the conservative breakdown (~1,200–1,500 weekday transactions), a reasonable interpretation is ~900–1,000 cups from repeat users (office staff in the Grade A tower cluster, metro commuters using nearby exits, and nearby residents), putting deterministic repeat cups above the 900/day threshold but, given realistic 5–7% conversion, implying only ~13–19k repeat passers/day; this falls below the ≥18k threshold for the higher band, so criterion 1 is scored in the high end of the ‘moderate repeat base’ band at 7.0. In the fixed 3‑hour morning window, the same logic yields roughly 500+ cups from repeat users (majority office and commuter driven), consistent with 6–10k morning repeat passers, which aligns well with the ‘strong commuter peak’ band, so criterion 2 is scored 8.3. The report shows substantial incremental leisure and mall-based demand (mall visitors, tourists, hotel guests, riverfront users) comfortably adding >200 cups/day in conservative scenarios, fitting a ‘strong leisure base’ (criterion 3 at 8.0). Micro-placement is very favorable: an L1 ground-floor unit in a podium directly by multiple metro exits and the main office tower lobby implies that a large fraction—likely 25–50%—of relevant flows pass within 30 m on natural paths, justifying a ‘good exposure’ score of 8.5 for criterion 4. Although competition is acknowledged (likely multiple chains in and around the mall), the report’s own deterministic volume calculations suggest node-level coffee demand comfortably above 3,000 cups/day, leaving room for a new store at 1,200–1,500/day without extreme price pressure; this supports a balanced/high-demand assessment, so criterion 5 is set at 8.0. The North Bund CBD with Grade A offices, a major metro station, and a modern mall is structurally stable with some upside and only limited dependence on volatile cruise flows, warranting an 8.6 for stability (criterion 6). Finally, the demographic fit is excellent: the catchment is dominated by white-collar office workers, high-end hotel guests, and affluent visitors in a premium mixed-use complex, clearly exceeding the ≥60% target-segment share for specialty coffee, so criterion 7 is rated 9.2. These sub-scores combine (subject to the rubric’s caps, which do not bind here) to an overall customer potential score of 7.9, reflecting a strong, CBD-level repeat base with a very robust morning funnel and substantial incremental leisure traffic, but not quite the absolute highest tier of city-prime commuter volume.

## Traffic & Accessibility: 7.4/10
The report supports a strong overall traffic & accessibility score driven by excellent path fit and a large captive office base, but with some uncertainty around exact storefront pass-by volumes. For A (6.0), while the analysis shows very high macro flows (40–50k station movements/day, 30–50k nearby office workers) and estimates 5–10.5k daily mall visitors with direct visibility to an L1 coffee unit, it does not quantify 07:00–10:00 corridor-specific traffic. Given that morning is only a portion of daily mall and commuter flow and that the exact micro-placement on L1 is unknown (likely 20–60 m from an atrium/main spine), a conservative interpretation is a meaningful but not top-tier morning corridor, consistent with 9–13.9k passers and a score of 6. For B (9.0), the narrative repeatedly stresses 0–3 minutes incremental walking for core commuter groups (metro→office, office→riverfront, parking→lobby), with many routes effectively passing the unit “on the way”; this matches the rubric’s ‘excellent on-path’ band where ≥70% of key commuters incur ≤2 minutes’ detour and no extra crossings. For C (9.0), the environment is clearly CBD/office-driven: 10–15k workers in the same tower, 30–50k workers within 1 km, and explicit focus on morning (metro→office) and late afternoon flows, with tourists and cruise passengers framed as secondary and episodic; this implies a commuter-dominant composition and strong alignment with 07:00–10:00 peaks. For D (6.0), there is one metro line (Line 12) virtually on top of the project plus several nearby bus stops; the station handles 40–50k passenger movements/day, of which the report estimates 8–15k or more have natural paths intersecting the plaza. That yields a moderate relevant volume (roughly in the 30–70k range once additional office and riverfront users are considered), fitting the rubric’s “moderate” bracket. For E (8.0), the report states ≈30–50k office workers plus ≈70k residents within 1 km, giving a combined base around 100–120k, which matches a dense urban core with at least one strong segment (workers). For F (9.0), the same-complex captive base is very large: 10–15k workers in White Magnolia Tower directly over the mall, plus hotel guests and some integrated neighboring towers accessible within 0–3 minutes indoors; the store is on L1 where lift cores open and where workers routinely pass, consistent with ≥15k captive workers/guests on daily paths. For G (8.0), the unit is on L1 (the primary circulation level) and likely within 20–60 m of an atrium or main internal spine, visible to most people entering from street, metro-related approaches, or internal vertical cores, though the report is careful to note that exact micro-position is unknown; this supports a ‘strong’ rather than ‘prime’ placement. For H (9.0), multiple structured garages under and around the plaza (800–1,200 spaces in the complex itself plus several adjacent facilities within ≈200 m) and easy access for office and hotel visitors imply well over 1,500 usable spaces within a 3–5 minute walk and practical drop-off, aligning with excellent car access. Weighted together without triggering any global caps, these subscores yield an overall traffic & accessibility score of 7.4, i.e., a strong but not absolute top-tier commuter location mainly limited by conservative assumptions on the precise morning pass-by volume at the storefront itself.

## Competition Analysis: 7.2/10
The analysis describes a very high-volume CBD/mall node with tens of thousands of daily users within a ≤5-minute detour, strong metro linkage, and dense office/mall traffic, and explicitly argues a realistic target of roughly 600–1,500 cups/day for a well-positioned entrant; this supports an RSV assessment in the upper ‘strong’ to lower ‘very strong’ band, scored at 8.4. At the same time, within 100 m there are 11–12 direct competitors and roughly 20–21 within 300 m, with many top chains present, which—relative to ~20,000–30,000 effective daily users—implies a very high per-capita outlet density and clear quantitative saturation, fitting the rubric’s ‘Poor’ range for Saturation at 3.8. The report, however, clearly identifies several monetizable white spaces (fastest commuter bar, mid-priced third place below Starbucks, and differentiated product/health focus), and links these to material incremental volume (hundreds of cups/day), justifying a ‘Good’ Positioning White Space score of 7.8. Anchor risk is substantial: Manner, Starbucks (core), Starbucks Reserve, M Stand, Cotti, Peet’s and others are all within roughly 0–120 m, with multiple strong brands effectively on the same flows, aligning with the rubric’s ‘Poor’ band for Anchor / Incumbent Risk at 4.0. Combining these with the specified weights (65/15/10/10) yields a weighted overall score of about 7.2, with no gating caps triggered given the strong node volume and absence of a 0–10 m hero flagship like a Roastery.
