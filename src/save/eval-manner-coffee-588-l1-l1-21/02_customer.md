## 2. Demographics within Various Radii

WorldPop data was successfully retrieved for **500 m**. For 300 m and 1,000 m I extrapolate based on typical central-Shanghai densities and the 500 m figure.

### 2.1 Population Estimates

Assumptions:
- 500 m radius area ≈ 0.785 km²  
- Typical inner-Shanghai density in such mixed-use core ≈ 20,000–30,000 residents/km²  
- WorldPop 500 m data implies ≈ 22,350 residents/km², reasonable for this area

From tool (500 m) and scaled estimates:

| Radius | Area (km²) | Estimated Residents | Basis |
|--------|------------|---------------------|-------|
| 300 m  | 0.283      | ≈ 6,300             | scale from 500 m density |
| 500 m  | 0.785      | **17,538**          | WorldPop result |
| 1,000 m| 3.142      | ≈ 70,300            | scale from 500 m density |

### 2.2 Age Structure (Residential Population)

Using WorldPop age composition (500 m) and extrapolating to 300 m and 1,000 m.

500 m radius (actual data, rounded):

- **Total residents:** 17,538  
- **Age 0–14:** 1,124 (6.4%)  
- **Age 15–59:** 10,440 (59.5%)  
- **Age 60–64:** 1,728 (9.9%)  
- **Age 65+:** 3,632 (20.7%)

Scaled to other radii (approx.):

| Radius | Total Pop | 0–14 | 15–59 | 60–64 | 65+ |
|--------|-----------|------|-------|-------|-----|
| 300 m  | 6,300     | 400  | 3,750 | 620   | 1,300 |
| 500 m* | 17,538    | 1,124| 10,440| 1,728 | 3,632 |
| 1,000 m| 70,300    | 4,510| 41,900| 6,900 | 14,600 |

\*Observed data.

**Implication for coffee shop:**
- Large **working-age (15–59)** base around 60% of residents.
- High share of **seniors (~31% over 60)**, creating daytime, slower-paced sit-down demand.
- But in this location, **office workers, tourists, and commuters** will significantly exceed pure residential demand.

## 3. Nearby Places & Activity Nodes (≤ 1,000 m)

Below: key categories, not exhaustive. Distances are straight-line from the shop.

### 3.1 Within the Same Complex (Baiyulan / White Magnolia Plaza)

- **White Magnolia/Sinar Mas Plaza Tower (Main office tower)**
  - 320 m mixed-use skyscraper; common descriptions cite it as major Grade A office stock.
  - Reasonable estimate: **10,000–15,000 office workers** (multiple anchor tenants, full-day presence).
- **Baiyulan Plaza Shopping Center (podium)**
  - Multi-level mall below the tower, mixed F&B, lifestyle, retail.
  - Comparable high-end downtown malls in Shanghai often see **10,000–30,000 visitors/day** depending on weekday/weekend.
  - Conservative assumption for this mall:  
    - **Weekday average:** 10,000–15,000 visitors/day  
    - **Weekend/holiday:** 20,000–30,000 visitors/day  
- **On-site Hotel (Baiyulan Plaza Hotel component and nearby branded hotels within same complex)**
  - Combined immediate complex hotels likely **400–600 rooms**.
  - With ~70–80% occupancy → **280–480 guests per night** on-site.

### 3.2 Transport & Commuter Nodes

- **International Cruise Terminal Metro Station (Line 12) & multiple exits**
  - Several station entrances within **30–150 m** of the shop.
  - Line 12 is a cross-city line; inner stations in core areas often handle **30,000–60,000 passenger entries+exits/day**.
  - Given adjacency to North Bund CBD + tourist area:
    - Reasonable working assumption: **40,000–50,000 metro passenger movements/day** at this station.
  - Only a fraction passes the mall corridor, but proximity (tens of meters) is extremely favorable.
- **Dongchangzhi Road traffic**
  - Major urban arterial; buses and taxis bringing office workers and tourists.
  - Adds incremental walk-in potential, but main quantified flow is metro and office workers.

### 3.3 Tourism & Leisure

Within 300–700 m:

- **North Bund International Passenger/Cruise Center & Cruise Tourism**
  - Directly north/east of the site (≈200–300 m).
  - 2024 article (Shanghai gov English site) notes **over 350,000 inbound/outbound cruise passengers** for the city since restart; North Bund is a key terminal but not all pass daily.
  - Realistic average through this terminal in current environment:
    - Several thousand passengers on cruise arrival/departure days (2,000–5,000/day).
    - Many **non-cruise days with minimal passenger traffic**.
- **North Bund Riverside Greenway & Parks (北外滩滨江绿地、航海公园等)**  
  - Multiple waterfront parks and public spaces within **200–500 m**.
  - Used for walking, jogging, photo spots; heavy **evening and weekend** usage.
  - On pleasant days, plausible **several thousand visitors/day** along the waterfront within 1 km of the shop.

### 3.4 Hotels (0–1,000 m)

Key high-end and business hotels:

- **W Shanghai – The Bund (外滩W酒店)** – ~170 m  
- **Banyan Tree Shanghai On the Bund** (not explicitly listed here but known nearby) – <1 km  
- **Moxy / other boutique & business hotels** scattered within 500–800 m  
- Additional hotels: Rose Garden Serviced Apartments, PuHua, etc. within ~300–800 m.

Estimated **hotel guest base within 1 km:**

- Combined **1,500–2,500 hotel rooms**.
- With ~70–80% occupancy → **1,050–2,000 guests per night**.
- A share will seek breakfast/coffee off-property.

### 3.5 Offices (Beyond White Magnolia Tower)

Within **1,000 m** radius, North Bund has:

- Multiple Grade A office buildings and complexes (e.g., **Shanggang Postal City (上港邮轮城)**, additional office blocks along Dongchangzhi Rd and Bei Suzhou River side).
- Conservatively: **30,000–50,000 office workers** in total within 1 km (including the 10,000–15,000 in White Magnolia Tower).

### 3.6 Residential

Within 500–1,000 m:

- Several residential clusters, though core of North Bund is more commercial than purely residential.
- Using demographic estimates:
  - **500 m**: 17,500 residents
  - **1,000 m**: ~70,000 residents
- Not all are within easy walking due to river and arterial roads, but a large subset is realistically **within 10–15 minutes’ walk**.

### 3.7 Education & Schools

Not prominent top-tier universities directly at the doorstep (this is more CBD/tourism than campus zone). Some schools will exist within 1 km but are not the dominant driver vs offices, metro, tourists.

## 4. Main Customer Sources

For a ground-floor coffee shop in a mall podium at this location, primary sources:

1. **Office Workers (Core Source)**
   - From White Magnolia Plaza tower and surrounding North Bund offices.
   - Main windows: weekday **7:30–10:00**, **11:30–14:00**, **15:00–18:00**.
   - Size:
     - In-tower workers: **10,000–15,000**
     - Additional workers within 600–1,000 m: extra **20,000–35,000**
   - Effective daily potential for your physical point (those likely to pass within mall):
     - **Deterministic reachable office population (daily presence around the site):**  
       ~10,000–15,000 (in-tower and directly adjacent buildings).

2. **Mall Shoppers & Visitors (Baiyulan Plaza Mall Footfall)**
   - Internal mall footfall is direct corridor traffic.
   - As reasoned:
     - Weekday: **10,000–15,000 visitors/day**
     - Weekend/holiday: **20,000–30,000 visitors/day**
   - Coffee penetration (people who buy coffee) might be **5–15%** of mall visitors, depending on competition and positioning.

3. **Metro Commuters (Line 12 – International Cruise Terminal Station)**
   - Estimated passengers/day at station: **40,000–50,000 movements (entries+exits)**.
   - Fraction likely to pass your unit:
     - Not all pass through the mall; if 20–30% find it convenient to walk via the mall level or street entrance near your unit:
       - **8,000–15,000 commuters/day** passing reasonably close.
   - Realistic coffee capture: ~2–5% of those using your egress paths.

4. **Tourists & Cruise Passengers**
   - **North Bund Cruise Terminal:**
     - On cruise days: **2,000–5,000 passengers/day**.
     - Many will walk towards The Bund or nearby malls/hotels; a fraction will pass Baiyulan Plaza.
   - **North Bund riverfront tourists:**
     - On good-weather weekends or holidays: several thousand additional visitors in 1 km.
   - Effective daily average (smoothed over year):
     - **1,000–2,000 potential coffee customers/day** in 1 km radius, but only a portion will come into the mall.

5. **Hotel Guests**
   - 1,050–2,000 guests per night in nearby hotels (within 1 km).
   - Morning coffee & late-night drinks are key use-cases.
   - Realistic effective daily reachable base (who might walk into this specific mall): **300–800 people/day**.

6. **Local Residents (within walking distance)**
   - 300–500 m: ~6,300–17,500 residents.
   - 1,000 m: ~70,300 residents.
   - Realistic segment that may regularly use this coffee shop:
     - **Daily or high-frequency users:** 1–3% of residents within 1 km → 700–2,000 regulars.
     - They will be smaller than office/tourist/mall traffic but important for **evenings and weekends**.

## 5. Customer Number Estimation

### 5.1 Deterministic Daily Customer Potential (Conservative)

This is an estimate of realistically reachable customer **visits** per day a well-run coffee shop could attract at this exact location, assuming:

- Competitive but not saturated coffee environment.
- Mid-market pricing, good quality, open full day.

We derive by conservative penetration of each flow:

1. **Office workers on-site (10,000–15,000)**
   - Assume 5–8% buy from this shop daily (many will prefer convenience on ground floor).
   - → **500–1,200 coffee transactions/day**

2. **Mall visitors (10,000–15,000 on weekday; using weekday averages)**
   - Assume 3–6% of mall visitors patronize this specific coffee shop.
   - → **300–900 transactions/day**

3. **Metro commuters passing by relevant exits (8,000–15,000)**
   - Assume 2–4% capture rate (many in a rush, some prefer convenience).
   - → **160–600 transactions/day**

4. **Tourists/cruise & riverfront visitors (effective 1,000–2,000/day near mall)**
   - Assume 5–10% capture into this shop.
   - → **50–200 transactions/day**

5. **Hotel guests (300–800 passing/considering this mall)**
   - Assume 10–20% buy at least 1 drink/day.
   - → **30–160 transactions/day**

6. **Local residents (~70,000 in 1 km, but smaller active base)**
   - Suppose 700–2,000 “active” nearby coffee users; each averages 0.2–0.3 visits/day to this shop (some come multiple times, others once a week).
   - → **140–600 transactions/day**

Now aggregating **conservatively** (using lower-end penetration):

- Offices: ~500  
- Mall: ~300  
- Metro: ~160  
- Tourists: ~50  
- Hotels: ~30  
- Residents: ~140  

**Conservative deterministic daily customer volume: ~1,200–1,500 transactions/day**  
For a coffee shop of this type, even 800–1,000/day would already be healthy; 1,200–1,500 is feasible given the flows and strong location within a Grade A mixed-use complex.

### 5.2 Potential Maximum Daily Customer Volume (Upper Bound)

Under favorable conditions: strong brand, attractive offering, limited immediate direct coffee competition on the same floor, and peak times (weekdays, holidays):

Using upper-range captures:

- Offices: up to ~1,200/day  
- Mall: up to ~900/day  
- Metro: up to ~600/day  
- Tourists: up to ~200/day  
- Hotels: up to ~160/day  
- Residents: up to ~600/day  

If all are optimized simultaneously (which in practice rarely happens), theoretical **upper-bound potential**:

- **~2,500–3,500 transactions/day**

A more realistic **high-performance range** after ramp-up would be:

- **1,800–2,200 transactions/day on strong weekdays**
- **2,000–2,500+ on major weekends/holidays**

---

## 6. Summary: Pros & Cons of the Location (In Customer Terms)

### Pros

- **High-intensity office catchment**
  - White Magnolia/Sinar Mas tower and surrounding North Bund offices provide **≥30,000 office workers within 1 km**, with **10,000–15,000 directly upstairs/next door**.
- **Direct access to metro station**
  - International Cruise Terminal Station (Line 12) is within **30–150 m** with **~40,000–50,000 passenger movements per day**, ensuring constant all-day flow.
- **Within a modern mall podium**
  - Baiyulan Plaza shopping center likely has **10,000–15,000 weekday visitors**, **20,000–30,000 weekend visitors**.
  - Being on **L1 ground floor** significantly increases visibility and impulse purchases.
- **Tourism and waterfront footfall**
  - North Bund riverfront and cruise terminal bring **thousands of tourists** on peak days, plus regular local leisure users.
- **High-income, professional customer base**
  - Grade A office tenants and high-end hotels suggest a strong base for **premium-priced coffee** and specialty drinks.
- **Large resident base within 1 km**
  - ~70,000 residents, including many seniors and families, offering stable non-office traffic, especially evenings/weekends.

### Cons / Risks

- **Footfall volatility for cruise tourists**
  - Cruise passenger flows are **highly uneven**, depending on ship schedules; they cannot be treated as stable daily volume.
- **Potential competition within mall and nearby**
  - Likely presence of **chain coffee brands** (Starbucks, Luckin, etc.) inside Baiyulan Plaza or adjacent buildings.
  - This can reduce attainable penetration rates on office and mall visitors.
- **Workday vs weekend pattern**
  - Office-driven trade yields strong weekday morning and lunch peaks;  
    weekends may rely more on mall and tourist traffic, which can be more weather/season dependent.
- **Limited direct residential “neighborhood cafe” feel**
  - Immediate streetscape is more corporate and touristic; residents exist but not as dense at building entrance as in purely residential compounds.
