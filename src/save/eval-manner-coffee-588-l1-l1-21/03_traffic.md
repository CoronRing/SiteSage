## 1. Public transit availability

**Key finding**: The shop is almost directly on top of Line 12 International Cruise Terminal Station and surrounded by several bus stops within 150–400 m. This gives dense, multi‑mode access for office workers, residents, tourists and cruise passengers.

### Subway

Nearby subway infrastructure (all distances are straight‑line from the coffee shop):

- **International Cruise Terminal Station (Line 12)**  
  - Station centroid: **≈86 m** away  
    - “国际客运中心(地铁站)” – 31.25016, 121.498158, distance 86 m.
  - Exits:
    - Generic exits (unlabeled): **≈32–104 m**
      - “国际客运中心地铁站出入口” – 32 m  
      - Another unlabeled exit – 57 m  
      - Exit 2 – 98 m  
      - Exit near 121.498815 – 104 m  
    - Exit 4 – **≈121 m**
    - Exit 1 – **≈147 m**

**Implications**

- A **1‑ to 2‑minute walk** from the platform to the mall ground floor is realistic, depending on vertical circulation.
- With **≈40,000–50,000 passenger movements/day** at this station (from previous analysis), a practical **8,000–15,000** people/day will pass along routes that can include Baiyulan Plaza or its sidewalks.

### Bus

Closest bus stops (primary ones within ≈350 m):

- **≤150 m**
  - “东大名路旅顺路(公交站)” – 118 m
  - “白玉兰广场(公交站)” – 120 m
  - “东长治路旅顺路(公交站)” – 130 m
  - “上港邮轮城(公交站)” – 149 m
- **150–400 m**
  - “唐山路新建路(公交站)” – 280 m  
  - “东大名路高阳路(公交站)” – 332 m  
  - “东汉阳路梧州路(公交站)” – 372 m  

**Implications**

- Practical **walk time from bus stop to shop**: ≈2–5 minutes.
- These bus stops extend the catchment to residential neighborhoods north and northwest, and to workers who do not use Line 12 directly.

### Rail / Other

- No mainline train station within 800 m; the dominant mass transit is metro + bus.
- The **International Passenger/Cruise Center** effectively functions as a periodic high‑volume traffic generator, feeding pedestrians directly into the same block as the plaza.

## 2. Parking availability

The store is inside a large mixed‑use complex with extensive structured parking. Within **≈250 m**:

- **Baiyulan Plaza / White Magnolia Plaza parking**
  - “上海白玉兰广场购物中心地下停车场” – 24 m (essentially under the mall)
  - Multiple entrances/exits at **72 m, 76 m, 122 m, 128–130 m, 184–189 m**
  - These car parks likely hold **hundreds of spaces** (typical for Grade‑A tower + mall), realistically **800–1,200+ stalls** combined in the complex.

- **Nearby office and hotel parking**
  - “雷士德工学院旧址地上停车场” – 120 m (surface parking)
  - “双狮汇地下停车场 / 大厦地下停车场” – 173–206 m
  - “上海外滩W酒店地下停车点” – ≈187–189 m
  - “中信/工行/建工大厦停车场” – ≈167–200 m
  - “北外滩滨江绿地地下停车场 / 上港国际客运中心地下停车场” – ≈158–220 m

**Implications**

- For **drivers** (office staff, residents from other districts, weekend visitors), the **door‑to‑door walk from car to coffee** is usually **2–4 minutes** via mall and tower access routes.
- Parking depth matches the earlier customer analysis assumption that **300–800 hotel guests/day** and a portion of the ~30,000–50,000 office workers can practically arrive by car and pop into the mall.

---

## 3. Customer flow analysis

Using both the previous customer analysis and the new traffic data:

### Main origin–destination (O–D) flows

1. **Metro → Office towers / workplaces**
   - Origin: Line 12 International Cruise Terminal Station  
   - Destinations:
     - White Magnolia Tower (10,000–15,000 workers)
     - Neighboring office towers west and east
   - Typical route:
     - Exit station to southern side near Dongdaming Road  
     - Cross Dongdaming Road and walk through or beside Baiyulan Plaza.
   - **Daily flow**:
     - From 40,000–50,000 station movements, approx. **15,000–20,000** are commuters for nearby offices.  
     - Assuming 50–70% walk via paths that pass **within 100–150 m** of the store, **≈7,500–14,000** people have easy incidental exposure each weekday.

2. **Office towers → Mall (lunch, coffee breaks, meetings)**
   - Origins: Offices north, west, and east of the mall (≈30,000–50,000 workers within 1 km; ≈10,000–15,000 in immediate tower)  
   - Destinations: F&B, coffee, light meals in Baiyulan Plaza L1–L3.
   - Flows:
     - Morning: coffee grab on the way from metro to lifts.
     - 11:30–13:30: lunch flows; high potential for takeaway drinks and quick meetups.
     - 15:00–17:00: coffee breaks, informal meetings.
   - Expected **daily pass‑by near store**:  
     - If 30–40% of office workers enter Baiyulan Plaza during a typical day:  
       - 0.3–0.4 × 10,000–15,000 ≈ **3,000–6,000** office workers/day entering the mall, many passing ground‑floor circulation where L1‑21 is located.

3. **Metro / bus → Riverfront leisure / tourists**
   - Origins: City‑wide visitors using Line 12 and buses; cruise passengers on cruise days.  
   - Destinations: North Bund waterfront, green belt, viewing platforms, Shanghai Port No.3 Plaza, cruise terminal.
   - Routes:
     - From metro exits, pedestrians walk south across Dongdaming Road, then through/along Baiyulan Plaza to the waterfront.
   - Effective daily potential:
     - **Tourists & cruise passengers**: ≈1,000–2,000/day on average within 1 km, peaking to 2,000–5,000 on cruise days.
     - **Local leisure traffic** (residents, office workers after work): several thousand/day on pleasant evenings and weekends, many walking right past L1 retail frontage.

4. **Bus / nearby residential blocks → Mall errands**
   - Origins: Northern/northwestern residential blocks and older neighborhoods; local white‑collar residents.
   - Destinations: Baiyulan Plaza retail, supermarket, banking, CGV T Space, etc.
   - Routes:
     - Alight at stops “白玉兰广场”, “东大名路旅顺路”, “上港邮轮城” etc., then walk 2–5 minutes to mall entrances.
   - Quantitative link:
     - **Around 70,000 residents** within 1 km, of whom **700–2,000** are likely regular coffee users (previous report).
     - A share of these use bus/metro; many errands include a pass through L1 circulation.

5. **Drivers (offices, hotels, visitors) → L1 retail**
   - Origins: Garage levels below Baiyulan Plaza and adjacent towers; W Hotel parking.
   - Destinations: Office floors, hotel lobby, F&B.  
   - Routes:
     - From parking elevators to ground floor public lobbies and into L1 corridors.
   - Because the **main lift cores often open to L1 atrium**, the walk from lifts to exits normally forces a pass‑by or near‑by to L1‑21.

## 4. Detour estimation

### Static map

Baiyulan Plaza coffee shop (A) in relation to metro, offices, and riverfront:

![Static map – Baiyulan Plaza and surroundings](https://restapi.amap.com/v3/staticmap?location=121.498083%2C31.249384&zoom=16&size=512%2A512&markers=mid%2C%2CA%3A121.498083%2C31.249384%7Cmid%2C%2CM%3A121.49872%2C31.25145%7Cmid%2C%2CO%3A121.4958%2C31.2486%7Cmid%2C%2CR%3A121.5009%2C31.2469&key=68913ce8db83f7bbe5b4cca9720c7a8f)

- **A** – Baiyulan Plaza (store location, L1‑21 inside)  
- **M** – Indicative metro exit area (International Cruise Terminal Station, north of Dongdaming Rd)  
- **O** – Office cluster to west/northwest  
- **R** – North Bund riverfront / green belt to south‑southeast

### Detour for key customer segments

Rule of thumb: **80 m ≈ 1 minute of walk** in an indoor/outdoor mixed environment, accounting for escalators and crossings.

1. **Metro commuters (M → offices)**  
   - Default route: Metro exit → cross Dongdaming Road → office lobby.  
   - If mall is used as **weather‑protected corridor**, many commuters already walk through L1.  
   - **Additional detour** to enter the coffee shop:
     - If shop is on a main L1 aisle: **0–1 minute** (0–80 m).
     - If slightly off main spine: **1–2 minutes** (80–160 m).
   - **5‑ and 10‑minute detour potential:**
     - 5‑minute envelope (≈400 m extra walk): essentially **all 10,000–15,000 nearby office workers using Line 12** can incorporate a coffee stop without significant time penalty.
     - 10‑minute envelope (≈800 m extra walk): would cover virtually the entire 1 km office catchment, but for routine workdays people rarely accept a 10‑minute pure detour; they will only do this when combining errands.

   **Estimated reachable volumes:**
   - **Within 5‑minute acceptable detour** for a workday coffee stop:
     - From metro commuters: **≈7,500–14,000** pax/day.
     - From internally connected offices: **≈8,000–12,000** workers have a ≤5‑min mall detour from lobby.
     - Combined non‑unique pool (some overlap): **≈12,000–18,000 individuals/day** could get coffee here with ≤5 min time cost.

2. **Office workers already in tower (lifts → L1 → outside/other floors)**
   - The coffee shop is effectively “on the way” when:
     - Going down for lunch.
     - Exiting to the riverside or metro.
   - **Extra detour**:
     - Passing by vs. entering: near zero.  
     - Waiting in line + purchase: total extra time is queue‑dependent (operations issue, not location).
   - Share of office population with **≤3‑minute added walk** to get coffee:
     - At least the **10,000–15,000** in White Magnolia Tower plus a large fraction from adjacent integrated towers.

3. **Riverfront visitors (R ↔ M / bus / parking)**  
   - Path: Riverfront → cross internal road → walk via or alongside Baiyulan Plaza to metro/bus/car.  
   - Entering the store from normal route:
     - **0–2 minutes** additional walk, since L1 is contiguous with main north–south pedestrian paths.
   - Within a **5‑minute detour**:
     - Essentially **all visitors** moving between riverfront and metro/parking (several thousand/day on busy days) have trivial detour.

4. **Mall‑focused visitors (already inside Baiyulan Plaza)**
   - For shoppers and diners in the plaza, the store is inside the same complex.
   - Detour to come specifically to the coffee shop:
     - **0–3 minutes**, depending on exact L1 location relative to main entrances and anchors.

### 5‑min / 10‑min detour population estimates

Based on the previous customer analysis and above movement logic:

- **5‑minute detour range (extra 400 m of walk)**  
  People for whom adding this coffee stop incurs ≤5 minutes of additional walking vs. their typical route:

  - **Office workers**:
    - White Magnolia Tower and directly integrated office complex: **≈10,000–15,000**
    - Adjacent towers in the same block and just across Dongdaming Road: an additional **≈5,000–8,000** routinely crossing the plaza or its perimeter.
    - Effective office population within 5‑minute detour: **≈15,000–23,000**.
  - **Daily transit users intersecting the block**:
    - Metro users whose paths already bring them near Baiyulan: **≈8,000–15,000**.
  - **Residents & tourists using riverfront / mall**:
    - Realistically, **2,000–5,000** persons/day are in the mall and riverfront + cruise area with a ≤5‑minute detour.

  Taking overlaps into account, a conservative combined **unique** daily pool within ≤5‑minute detour is roughly:

  - **≈20,000–30,000 individuals/day**.

- **10‑minute detour range (extra 800 m of walk)**  
  This covers:

  - Pretty much all **30,000–50,000 office workers within 1 km**.
  - Almost all of the **70,000 residents within 1 km** (but many of them will not treat this destination as routine).
  - Tourists and cruise passengers across the 1‑km waterfront.

  However, 10‑minute pure detours are mainly relevant for **weekend leisure** or **planned meetings**, not for daily coffee. Still, the 10‑minute envelope indicates a very large **potential maximum pool** of **≈80,000–120,000** people in the area who could choose this store when they are already nearby.

---

## 5. Visibility analysis

### Macro‑visibility (street and district level)

- The static map and POIs show the store is in the **central block south of Dongdaming Road (东大名路)**:
  - Dongdaming Road is an east–west **primary arterial** in the North Bund.
  - Directly north: metro station concourse, cruise terminal and additional offices.
  - Directly south: open **North Bund riverside green belt** and promenades.

- **Vehicle visibility**:
  - Drivers on Dongdaming Road see Baiyulan Plaza as one of the **dominant massings** on the south side of the street; however the coffee shop itself, located on L1 inside the mall, will be largely **inward‑facing** or oriented to pedestrian plaza/atrium rather than roads.
  - Signage at **mall entrances and canopies** facing Dongdaming Road and the internal south loop road can give indirect visibility.

### Micro‑visibility (inside mall / pedestrian flows)

- Location is L1‑21 on **L1 (ground floor)**:
  - L1 is typically the **highest pedestrian circulation** level in a modern plaza, connecting street entrances, metro connections (if any indirect links), and vertical cores to upper floors.
  - Being on **L1 vs. B1 or upper levels** significantly improves spontaneous purchase probability for:
    - Morning commuters.
    - Quick lunch/coffee runs.
    - People walking from offices to riverfront or back.

- Internal orientation:
  - Exact micro‑position (near main atrium vs. side corridor) is not given, but given L1‑21 and the high‑density L1 layout:
    - The unit is likely **within 20–60 m** of at least one main entrance or atrium.
    - Combined daily **mall traffic** of ≈10,000–15,000 weekdays (20,000–30,000 weekends) will pass through central L1 routes.

**Quantitative visibility impact**

- If we assume:
  - **50–70%** of mall visitors pass within 30–50 m sightline of a L1 coffee shop near main circulation:
    - Weekdays: 0.5–0.7 × 10,000–15,000 ≈ **5,000–10,500** people/day with direct visual exposure.
    - Weekends: 0.5–0.7 × 20,000–30,000 ≈ **10,000–21,000** people/day.
- Combined with through‑flow from offices and metros, the coffee shop can expect **very frequent repeat exposure** to the same office and commuter population plus **high cumulative impressions** among tourists and residents.

## 6. Summary: Pros and Cons in terms of traffic

### Pros

- **Extremely close mass transit**
  - Metro station exits within **32–150 m**; realistic **1–2 minute** walk from platform to shop via mall, linking to a **40,000–50,000** passenger‑movement station.
  - Multiple bus stops within **120–150 m**, connecting to wider city neighborhoods, with short walks (2–5 minutes).

- **Strong structured parking environment**
  - Multiple large underground parking facilities within **<200 m**, serving offices, mall and hotels.
  - Good for high‑spending car‑born customers, especially evenings and weekends.

- **Highly favorable customer flows**
  - **Office workers:** ≈30,000–50,000 within 1 km; **10,000–15,000** in same tower. Many pass through or by L1 daily.
  - **Mall visitors:** ≈10,000–15,000 visitors/day on weekdays, 20,000–30,000 on weekends.
  - **Tourists/cruise/riverfront visitors:** ≈1,000–2,000/day effective potential; much higher on peak cruise and event days.
  - **Local residents:** ≈70,000 within 1 km, **700–2,000** likely regular coffee users.

- **Low incremental detour**
  - For metro commuters and office workers, visiting the shop usually costs **0–3 extra minutes** of walking, well below the 5‑minute friction threshold.
  - Estimated **20,000–30,000 people/day** are within a ≤5‑minute detour range in their normal routines.

- **Good internal visibility**
  - L1 location ensures heavy exposure to:
    - Office workers moving between lifts and street/riverfront.
    - People entering from metro/bus and internal parking.
    - Mall shoppers and cinema/CGV visitors.

### Cons / Risks

- **Visibility constrained to inside‑mall pedestrians**
  - The unit is inside Baiyulan Plaza; direct line‑of‑sight from street or metro exit may be partial.
  - Brand must rely on **mall signage, wayfinding, and digital discovery** to capture external flows.

- **High competition for coffee and F&B**
  - A dense Class‑A CBD mall and North Bund corridor typically hosts multiple coffee chains and boutique cafés.
  - Even with strong traffic, **market share per brand** can be squeezed, influencing the earlier transaction ranges (1,200–1,500/day typical, up to 2,500–3,500/day upper bound).

- **Traffic pattern variability**
  - Cruise passenger flows are **episodic**, not stable.
  - Office demand is strong on weekdays but may **drop significantly on weekends** (partially offset by tourists and leisure visitors).

---

### Overall traffic conclusion

From a **traffic and accessibility standpoint**, the L1‑21 unit in Baiyulan Plaza is in a **top‑tier CBD transit node**:

- Directly adjacent to a busy Line 12 station and multiple bus lines.
- Embedded in a large office + hotel + mall + waterfront ecosystem.
- Servicing a **large and diverse base** of commuters, office workers, residents, tourists, and riverfront visitors with **minimal detour costs**.

These characteristics fully support the prior estimate that a capable operator can reach **≈1,200–1,500 coffee transactions/day** in steady state, with upside to **≈1,800–2,200/day** or more in strong conditions, provided the concept competes effectively on product, speed, and brand differentiation.
