# Weighting Rationale

- **Store context**: Coffee shop on the ground floor of Baiyulan Plaza, a commercial property in Shanghai, positioned to serve mall visitors, nearby office workers, and passersby.
- **Traffic & Accessibility (0.40)**
  - Mall-based coffee shops depend heavily on internal foot traffic and visibility within the plaza.
  - High visit frequency (daily coffee runs) makes convenience, proximity to entrances, escalators, and office flows critical.
  - Being easy to access during commuting and break times is a primary driver of volume.
- **Customer (0.30)**
  - The concept serves a relatively broad demographic (office workers, shoppers, some residents), so it is not ultra-niche.
  - Still important to understand income levels, work patterns, and lifestyle (e.g., preference for specialty coffee vs. value options) to set pricing, menu, and seating strategy.
  - Repeat behavior from regulars (office tenants, mall staff) is important but secondary to raw traffic availability.
- **Competition (0.30)**
  - Shanghai malls typically host multiple beverage options (international coffee chains, local cafés, tea and juice brands), creating a competitive environment.
  - Customers can easily switch between similar offerings; brand, quality, and promotions matter but cannot fully offset poor positioning relative to competitors.
  - Competition is therefore important, but the fundamental driver remains capturing the plaza's overall traffic, so it is kept equal to customer and below traffic.
