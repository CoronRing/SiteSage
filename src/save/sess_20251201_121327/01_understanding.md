- The map center (marker **A**) sits just north of **南京东路 (Nanjing East Road)**, one of Shanghai's prime commercial and pedestrian corridors.
- To the **south**, within a very short walking distance, is Nanjing East Road itself and the **南京东路地铁站 (Nanjing East Road Metro Station)** on Line 2 and another line, bringing sustained commuter and visitor flow.
- To the **south‑west** and **south‑east**, there are major retail complexes such as large shopping plazas and department stores, forming a dense shopping and dining environment with heavy foot traffic.
- To the **north**, within a few blocks, lie multiple residential communities (marked as 小区), contributing nearby residents who can walk to the shop in a few minutes.
- To the **west**, the urban fabric continues toward the People’s Square area with more commercial and civic functions, indicating that office workers and visitors may also pass through this vicinity.
