# Understanding

You plan to open a **coffee shop** at **上海南阳路205号（101室）**, which geocodes to a point in **静安区, 上海市**, on 南阳路.

- The exact coordinates are approximately **31.2276°N, 121.4503°E**.
- The location sits in a **mixed urban residential and local-commercial area** in Jing'an District.
- Immediately around the point are several **residential compounds** (e.g., 北安阳小区 to the north, 南阳小区 to the east) within a very short walking distance.
- A bit further north, beyond the immediate block, are major roads (like the 长宁路 / 延安西路 corridor) and metro-connected areas, indicating **strong connectivity** and **stable pedestrian flows**.
- To the east and southeast, there are denser commercial and office areas and public facilities (such as stadium and shopping/office complexes) at a short distance, which can provide additional customer sources beyond the immediate residents.

The site therefore benefits from proximity to dense residential neighborhoods, nearby office/mixed-use buildings, and good access to larger commercial belts and transit, all within a compact urban radius.

The marker **A** on the map indicates the approximate storefront position on 南阳路, surrounded by multi-block residential compounds and small street-front businesses, with larger commercial and institutional clusters at a slightly greater but still convenient walking distance.
