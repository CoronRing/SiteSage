# Weighting Rationale

- **Store type:** Coffee Shop / Café in an urban Shanghai neighborhood (南阳路)
- **Business model:** Relies on frequent, repeat visits from nearby residents, office workers, and passersby; mix of planned and impulse visits.

- **Customer (0.31)**
  - Coffee shops serve a broad but still somewhat defined segment (young professionals, students, nearby workers/residents).
  - Local demographics (income, lifestyle, office vs. residential mix) influence average spend and repeat frequency.
  - Important, but not as dominant as pure convenience/traffic.

- **Traffic & Accessibility (0.39)**
  - Daily coffee consumption is habit-driven; high visibility and easy access are critical.
  - Foot traffic, proximity to workplaces/residences, and ease of entry (street frontage, transit access) strongly impact sales volume.
  - Aligns with rubric: coffee shops should lean toward higher traffic weight (0.35–0.40).

- **Competition (0.30)**
  - Coffee is a competitive category, but a well-positioned shop can differentiate via quality, ambiance, and service.
  - Nearby chains and independents matter, yet strong traffic and a suitable customer base can offset moderate competition.
  - Set at the lower end of the typical coffee-shop competition range to reflect that, for this concept, getting the right location and flows is slightly more critical than the existing competitive set.
