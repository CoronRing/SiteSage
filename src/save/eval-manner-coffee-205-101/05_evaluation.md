# Evaluation Scores

## Customer Analysis: 4.6/10
The analysis is detailed and clearly positions this as a dense inner‑city residential/community node rather than a prime commuter funnel. The report’s own conservative baseline of ~90–150 daily customers and a likely majority coming from residents, schools, hospitals and gyms implies deterministic repeat cups in roughly the 60–120/day range, placing weekday repeat strength in the weak–moderate band (score 4.5) with repeat passers probably only in the low thousands on a typical weekday. Morning‑peak volumes are not emphasized and the site is not on a metro exit or major CBD corridor; the morning window is likely limited to scattered residents and some office/medical staff (around 30–80 cups in 3 hours), fitting a “limited morning peak” band (3.8). Irregular/leisure flows from malls, parks, and especially one‑off hospital visitors add meaningful but not massive incremental volume; the report suggests an upside of a few dozen extra cups per weekday, which is consistent with a moderate leisure base (6.2). Micro‑placement is a street‑level neighborhood storefront off the primary Nanjing West transit axes and outside large malls, so only a modest share of node‑wide flows pass naturally, yielding low‑moderate exposure (4.8). Competitive pressure is clearly high within 1 km given multiple strong chains and specialty brands in nearby malls, while overall deterministic coffee demand is healthy but not enormous for this specific street, leading to a “tight but not disastrous” competition score (5.8). Long‑term flow stability is strong thanks to established hospitals, schools, residential density, and proximity to a major, mature CBD, justifying a high stability score (8.0). Finally, demographic fit is very good: the area is wealthy, central Jing’an with many white‑collar workers and students, and an existing coffee culture, even though there is also a sizable elderly population; this supports a strong demographic/price fit score (8.5). When weighted, the relatively weak repeat and morning‑peak fundamentals drag the overall result to 4.6, and the global cap based on those two dimensions also prevents a higher total even though stability and demographic fit are strong.

## Traffic & Accessibility: 4.7/10
The report describes a location on a secondary residential/“life street” (南阳路), explicitly not on the main ‘地铁口⇄商场/办公楼’ commuter corridors. Most office workers and out-of-area visitors have to deviate from their shortest desire lines, and first-eye exposure from the heaviest flows on 南京西路/延安路 is low. That implies relatively small 0–30 m morning pass-by volumes, so A is scored weak at 3.5. Detour fit (B) is mixed: nearby residents and some offices/体育馆 users can include the store with ≤3–5 extra minutes, but for the majority of 南京西路核心白领 coming via metro the extra 4–7 minutes and non-direct routing are significant, so B is set to a moderate 5.0. Commuter composition (C) around the broader area is strong: a large white-collar base, clear workday peaks, and many repeat users, even though the unit is slightly off their main paths, so C is 8.0. Macro transit access (D) is good in absolute terms (multiple metro lines and dense bus network within 600–1,000 m), but only a small share of those station flows naturally walk toward this specific side street; this warrants a capped but solid 6.0. The 1 km catchment is dense (≈77k residents plus 50–80k workers), yielding a high base and justifying E = 8.0. However, there is essentially no true captive population directly upstairs or internally connected (no large tower or mall integration), so F is very low at 1.5. Within its immediate ‘project’ context the unit is a streetfront on a minor road, visible once you are already on 南阳路 but not on primary transit→office desire lines, hence weak-to-moderate in-project visibility at G = 4.0. Car and parking access is notably strong, with numerous sizable car parks within 200–800 m and easy walking distances after parking, so H is scored high at 9.0. Applying the rubric’s weightings and the caps driven by low A and low F yields an overall traffic & accessibility score of 4.7, reflecting a fundamentally off-axis but dense urban neighborhood site that depends on intentional visits and local familiarity rather than raw commuter pass-by volume.

## Competition Analysis: 4.3/10
The analysis itself estimates a realistic neutral scenario of roughly 190–300 visits/day (≈210–330 cups), with an upper bound of 320–450 cups; given the heavy nearby competition and off-metro micro-position, a conservative sustainable RSV around 280–320 cups/day is reasonable, which falls in the rubric’s “Weak” band and supports an Effective Node Volume score of 4.3. Saturation is clearly very high: about 15–18 direct coffee competitors within 200 m and ~45–55 primary coffee outlets within 500 m in a dense but finite catchment, plus per‑capita estimates of roughly 1 venue per 700–900 residents; however, the report does not show visible widespread weakness or closures, so this aligns with “Poor” rather than “Extreme saturation,” yielding 3.5 on Saturation & Per-capita Competition. The report articulates a credible, differentiated niche—community living room,陪诊-friendly, gym/health-oriented, laptop-friendly street café distinct from both discount commuter chains and high-priced mall specialty—suggesting some real but execution-dependent white space with incremental uplift likely in the 150–250 cups/day range vs a generic offer, consistent with an “Adequate” Positioning White Space score of 6.0. Anchor risk is materially high: a Manner window unit is co-located at 0 m, Luckin and Starbucks are within ~200 m, and multiple other top-tier chains (Manner, Blue Bottle, %Arabica, Peet’s, Seesaw, Tims) cluster within 500 m, heavily covering the same commodity and mainstream segments; while not a Roastery-level flagship, this cluster fits the rubric’s “Poor” anchor risk band, so 3.5 is appropriate. Weighted together (65/15/10/10) and with no gating caps triggered (ENV > 4.0 and no formal hero flagship), this yields a final net competitive favorability score of 4.3, reflecting a node with strong underlying coffee demand but weak net opportunity due to extreme nearby competition and anchor strength, partially offset by plausible niche positioning potential.
