# Evaluation Scores

## Customer Analysis: 9.1/10
The customer report strongly supports a high customer-potential score. Residential density is high (≈19k within 500 m, 86k within 1 km) and is further amplified by very heavy office and mall-based daytime populations, fitting the rubric’s ‘city-level super-hub’ definition for catchment (≈9.3/10). Demographic and spending fit are excellent: the core 15–59 segment dominates and the area is already saturated with successful coffee brands, showing strong category spend (≈9.0/10). The analysis of behavior and dayparts is detailed, with segmented, quantitative estimates for metro commuters, office workers, shoppers, students, and residents, and realistic conversion ranges that align tightly with a commuter-focused boutique concept; this justifies an ‘excellent’ but not perfect daypart score (≈9.1/10) given some dependence on assumed throughputs. Opportunities and risks are laid out clearly—high upside but also intense competition, rent, and operational constraints—supporting a ‘good’ outlook (≈8.0/10). Weighted by the rubric, these yield an overall customer potential score of about 9.1/10, indicating a very strong but execution-sensitive location from a customer-base standpoint.

## Traffic & Accessibility: 8.9/10
On public transit connectivity, the report clearly describes a top-tier node: three metro lines, many exits within 50–300 m, daily throughput around 180k–250k, and direct underground connection to the project, matching the rubric’s highest band for city hubs (≈9.2/10). Walkability and road access are also very strong, with continuous sidewalks, mostly sheltered routes via the mall, and substantial nearby parking, justifying a high ‘good-to-excellent’ score (≈8.8/10). Target customer mobility fit is excellent: office and student commuters can usually reach the store with ≤1–3 minutes of extra walking, and the analysis explicitly quantifies detour times and 5-/10-minute acceptable ranges, aligning with the rubric’s ‘≤3 minutes for most’ condition (≈9.0/10). For traffic volume and temporal benefits, macro volumes are clearly huge and early-morning alignment is strong, but the unknown exact mall corridor position and lack of guaranteed placement on the single primary spine argue for a slightly lower, though still high, score (≈8.7/10). Applying rubric weights (20/10/10/60) yields an overall traffic and accessibility score of about 8.9/10: this is an elite transit and access location whose realized storefront pass-by will depend materially on internal mall placement.

## Competition Analysis: 5.4/10
Competitor density is extremely high: ≈13 direct coffee brands within 200 m (including multiple inside the same mall) and at least 30–35 within 400 m, plus dozens of bakery/dessert substitutes. By the rubric’s interior-mall hyper-cluster rule—four or more branded chain coffee/tea units plus several bakery cafes within ≈150 m—this sub-score should sit at or below about 3.5; given several chains are within ≈25–50 m on the same micro-flows, a density score of ≈2.8/10 is appropriate. Market saturation versus demand is closer to balanced: the report quantitatively matches 15k–35k cups/day of capacity to 12.5k–35k cups/day of potential demand in a very high-penetration node, implying neither clear oversupply nor unmet demand and fitting the rubric’s ‘adequate’ band (≈6.0/10). Positioning opportunity is limited but non-zero: the report identifies niches in fast, quality commuter takeaway and breakfast combinations between low-price chains and premium third spaces, which supports an ‘adequate’ score slightly above mid-band (≈5.8/10) after applying the clustered-mall downward adjustment. Competitive risk is significant, with a Starbucks Reserve and multiple strong chains (Manner, Luckin, Cotti, etc.) within ≈25–150 m targeting overlapping dayparts, but not so extreme as to preclude entry outright; this aligns with the rubric’s ‘adequate to poor’ boundary, here scored ≈5.0/10 after applying the mall-cluster downward tilt. Weighted (20/30/25/25), these sub-scores produce an overall competition score of about 5.4/10, indicating a very tough but not hopelessly oversaturated environment where success depends heavily on precise location and outstanding execution.

## Final Weighted Score: 8.0/10
