## 2. Demographics Around the Site

Population stats from WorldPop (residential, not including tourists / commuters).

### 2.1 Population & Age Structure

| Radius from store | Total population | Age 0–14 | Age 15–59 | Age 60–64 | Age 65+ |
|-------------------|-----------------|----------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **3 km**          | **≈64,680**     | ≈7,472 (11.6%) | ≈46,567 (72.0%) | ≈4,180 (6.5%) | ≈9,902 (15.3%) |
| **5 km**          | **≈219,657**    | ≈24,514 (11.2%) | ≈157,735 (71.8%) | ≈14,183 (6.5%) | ≈33,049 (15.0%) |
| **10 km**         | **≈1,153,525**  | ≈122,941 (10.7%) | ≈819,388 (71.0%) | ≈63,414 (5.5%) | ≈140,152 (12.2%) |

**Interpretation for a coffee shop:**

- Around **70–72%** of residents are **working-age (15–59)** – the most relevant for coffee consumption.
- Within **3–5 km**, you have:
  - **Deterministic nearby residential base:**  
    - 3 km: ≈46.6k working-age  
    - 5 km: ≈157.7k working-age  
- But this area’s economic engine is **tourism & leisure**, so **tourist + shopper inflow dominates daily coffee demand** more than pure residence.

## 3. Nearby Places & Catchment Structure

### 3.1 Major Commercial & Attraction Anchors (Primary Footfall Drivers)

- **Shanghai Village (上海奕欧来 / 比斯特上海购物村)**  
  - Category: Outlet mall (luxury & premium).  
  - Distance: Inside – your unit is along the inner promenade.  
  - Size: >200 boutiques (per official site).  
  - Footfall: No official public annual number, but must be consistent with:
    - Location inside **Shanghai International Resort**, which expected **≈20 million tourists in 2023** (China Daily via resort administration).
    - Positioned as the **premium outlet** serving Shanghai Disney traffic.
  - **Working assumption:**  
    - If Shanghai International Resort attracts **≈20 million visitors/year**, and even **35–45%** of them visit Shanghai Village at least once:
      - Conservative: 20m × 0.35 ≈ **7.0 million visits/year**  
      - Mid: 20m × 0.40 ≈ **8.0 million**  
      - Upper: 20m × 0.45 ≈ **9.0 million**  
    - We will use **7–9 million annual outlet visitors** as a reasonable range.

- **Shanghai Disney Resort / Shanghai Disneyland**  
  - Theme park attendance:  
    - 2023 estimate ≈ **13+ million visitors** (TheParkDB / industry analysis).  
  - Distance from store:  
    - Park entry & resort hotels ~1–1.5 km walking / shuttle distance.  
  - Relevance:  
    - A portion of Disney guests allocate **half-day or evening** to outlet shopping & dine, generating high share of **tourist coffee demand**, especially:
      - Mornings (before park).
      - Evenings (after park).
      - Rainy / cold days when park time is shorter.

- **Shanghai International Resort (whole area)**  
  - 2023: **≈20 million visitors** expected (China Daily / official resort admin).  
  - Includes: Disneyland, Disneytown, Shanghai Village, various resort hotels, supporting attractions and parks.

### 3.2 Transport Hubs (Accessibility)

Within ≈1.5 km:

- **Metro stations**
  - **迪士尼 (Disney) Metro Station, Line 11** – ~1.25–1.4 km.
  - **唐黄路 Station** – ~0.64 km.
  - Multiple exits (1–4号口 etc.), indicating good access from wider Shanghai.

- **Bus stops (selection)** – all ~0.3–1.4 km:
  - 申迪东路购物村站, 购物村站, 购物村东站.
  - 唐黄路航城路, 唐黄路阳光大道.
  - 航城路鹿川路, 航城路灵感街.
  - 迪士尼地铁站, 迪士尼地铁站公交枢纽.
- Implication:
  - High **day-trip accessibility** from Pudong & rest of Shanghai, supporting strong **non-local inflow**.

### 3.3 Hotels & Accommodation (repeat & overnight demand)

Within ≈1.5 km:

- **Immediate hotel cluster (≈0.45–0.9 km)**  
  - 上海百万石温泉酒店 (≈463 m)  
  - 上海拾光元素精品民宿 (≈532 m)  
  - 上海花涧花园酒店 (≈835 m)  
  - 上海迪舍酒店 (≈842 m)  
  - 向往度假酒店 (≈832 m)  
  - 莱迪主题酒店 (≈850 m)  
  - 上海四叶草主题酒店 (≈1.19 km)  
  - 其他多家精品/主题酒店 & 民宿（>10家列出，合计客房数量保守估计 1,500–2,000 间）

- **Disney flagship hotels (~1.3–1.5 km)**
  - 上海迪士尼乐园酒店 (5-star).
  - 玩具总动员酒店等。

**Hotel-based customer potential** (rough estimate):
- Assume within 1.5 km:
  - **2,500–3,500 rooms total** (Disney hotels + resort cluster + B&Bs).
  - **Average occupancy 70%** annually.
  - Average **2.5 guests/room**.
- Then daily in-house guests ≈:
  - Rooms × occ × guests/room  
  - 2,500 × 0.7 × 2.5 ≈ **4,375 guests/day**  
  - 3,500 × 0.7 × 2.5 ≈ **6,125 guests/day**
- Reasonably, **4,000–6,000 overnight tourists nearby per day** in peak seasons, somewhat lower in off-season.

If **10–20%** of these purchase a coffee in the outlet during their stay (1–2 days):
- Daily coffee-relevant hotel visitors ≈ **400–1,200 persons/day**.

### 3.4 Residential Context

Within 3–5 km, the following characteristics:
- Multiple **planned residential blocks** described south/southeast of the outlet.
- WorldPop indicates:
  - 3 km radius: total **≈64.7k residents**.
  - 5 km radius: total **≈219.7k residents**.
- This likely includes:
  - Parts of **Chuansha / 航城片区** and new communities built around the resort.
  - Workers in tourism, hospitality, and services (living nearby).

**For coffee demand:**
- If we conservatively assume:
  - **5 km local residents:** ≈219.7k
  - Proportion that visits the outlet multiple times per year: assume **20–30%** (as it’s a destination retail, not a neighborhood plaza):  
    - 219.7k × 0.25 ≈ **54,900 unique nearby residents** visiting per year.
  - Average outlet visits per visiting resident: **3 times/year**.
  - This gives ≈ **165k resident visits/year** to outlet.
- If **25–35%** of those visits generate at least one coffee purchase somewhere in the outlet:
  - Coffee-friendly resident visits ≈ **41k–58k/year**.

### 3.5 Offices / Schools / Other

- Within 5 km, the dominant POIs are **resort & tourism, hotels, parks, transport**.  
- No major university clusters or dense office CBDs directly adjacent.
- Therefore, **weekday commuter / office-worker coffee** is significantly smaller than in downtown Pudong or Lujiazui and should not be primary positioning.

## 4. Main Customer Sources for the Coffee Shop

Ranking by expected volume:

1. **Shanghai Village Outlet Shoppers (Core)**  
   - Annual outlet visitors estimated **7–9 million**.  
   - Demographics: domestic tourists, Shanghai residents on day-trip, some international tourists.  
   - Behavior:
     - Long dwell time (2–4 hours).  
     - Coffee used as **rest + social + “check-in”** item.
   - For coffee:
     - In a typical mature outlet village, **10–20%** of visitors buy at least one coffee/beverage in F&B units.
     - With multiple F&B competitors, an individual coffee shop’s share typically **3–8%** of all visitors (depending on visibility, brand, capacity).

2. **Shanghai Disney Visitors Spilling Over to Outlet**  
   - Shanghai Disneyland visitors **≈13+ million/year**.
   - Fraction that goes to Shanghai Village during their Disneyland trip:
     - Assume **20–35%** (given direct adjacency and integrated resort marketing).
     - 13m × 0.20 to 0.35 ≈ **2.6–4.55 million Disney-origin visits** to outlet/year (already partially counted in the 7–9m outlet total; do not double-count for overall mall footfall, but relevant to profile).
   - These visitors may:
     - Seek **coffee & snacks** before entering park (morning).
     - Stop by for **dessert/coffee in evening** after park closes.

3. **Resort Hotels & Nearby Accommodation Guests**  
   - ≈4,000–6,000 overnight guests/day in 1.5 km range (peak), lower in off peak.
   - Many plan at least one half-day for outlet shopping; strong breakfast & nightcap coffee potential.

4. **Local Residents within 3–5 km**  
   - Working-age population ~158k (5 km radius).  
   - Behavior:
     - Some use outlet for **weekend leisure, dining, cinema (if exists), window-shopping**.
   - For your store:
     - Repeat customer base for **weekday evenings & weekends**, albeit smaller than tourist share.

5. **Employees of the Resort & Outlet Retailers**  
   - Shanghai Village + hotels + Disney + support services likely support **several thousand staff**.  
   - If we very conservatively assume:
     - 5,000–8,000 employees within 1.5 km.
     - 10–20% buy coffee on working days.
   - Potential coffee-demanding staff per workday: **500–1,600 persons** (shared across all coffee/F&B vendors).

## 5. Customer Number Estimation

This section focuses on **annual and daily potential customers** for your coffee shop  
— not cups, but **unique purchasing visits (transactions)**.

### 5.1 Deterministic / Conservative Estimate

**Step 1 – Base outlet visitors used for coffee-shop potential:**

- Use low-end outlet footfall: **7 million visits/year**.

**Step 2 – % of outlet visitors who buy any coffee (from any vendor)**

- Assume conservative **10%** (tourist retail tends to be higher, but we keep conservative).  
- 7,000,000 × 10% = **700,000 coffee-buying visitors/year** (across all coffee/beverage outlets in Shanghai Village).

**Step 3 – Market share for this one coffee shop**

Key factors:
- Location inside the mall (lakeside promenade w/ good visibility).
- Likely 3–6 direct coffee competitors (chain + boutique) across the village.
- Reasonable conservative share: **8–12%** of the coffee-occasion traffic.

Use **10%** as mid-conservative:

- 700,000 × 10% ≈ **70,000 coffee-purchasing visits/year**.

**Step 4 – Add local-resident and staff repeat demand**

- Resident coffee-friendly visits estimated earlier ≈ **41k–58k/year**.
- Suppose your store captures **20–30%** of this:
  - 41k × 0.2 ≈ 8,200  
  - 58k × 0.3 ≈ 17,400  
  - Use mid ≈ **12,000 visits/year** from local residents.

- Staff demand (employees of resort & mall & hotels):
  - Assume **6,000 staff**, 250 working days, 15% buy coffee per workday, and you capture 15% of staff coffee share:
    - Total staff-coffee-occasions/year: 6,000 × 0.15 × 250 = **225,000** (across all outlets).
    - Your share (15%): ≈ **33,750 transactions/year**.  
  - This seems high vs. outlet footfall; to keep overall conservative, cap your staff-related transactions to **15,000–20,000/year**.

Use mid **17,000 staff transactions/year**.

**Step 5 – Sum conservative annual customer visits**

- From outlet tourist/shoppers: ≈ **70,000/year**
- From local residents: ≈ **12,000/year**
- From staff: ≈ **17,000/year**

**Deterministic conservative annual total:**  
**≈ 99,000 customer visits/year** (round to **95,000–105,000**).

**Average per day (365 days):**  
- ≈ **260–290 coffee-purchasing customers/day**.

Given seasonality (high peaks in Golden Week, summer, weekends), typical pattern:
- **Peak days:** 400–700 transactions/day may be needed.
- **Low weekdays/off-season:** 120–200/day.

### 5.2 Potential / Upper-Bound Estimate

Now consider more optimistic but still reasoned assumptions.

**Step 1 – Use upper outlet visitor range**

- Upper outlet footfall: **9 million visits/year**.

**Step 2 – % visitors who purchase coffee/coffee drinks**

- Assume **18%** (realistic in a high-leisure, heavy F&B environment):
  - 9,000,000 × 18% ≈ **1,620,000 coffee-buying visitors/year** (all vendors).

**Step 3 – Individual shop market share in good case**

- Strong brand, good facade, strategic lakeside seating = **12–18%** share of coffee traffic.  
- Use mid **15%**:
  - 1,620,000 × 15% ≈ **243,000 coffee-purchasing visits/year** from outlet visitors.

**Step 4 – Local residents & staff in high case**

- Residents: keep mid (store’s capability to serve locals is limited by mall trips).  
  - ≈ **12,000–15,000/year** → use **15,000**.
- Staff: high share and habit:
  - Assume your store captures **25,000–30,000** staff visits/year.  
  - Use **27,000**.

**Step 5 – Sum upper-bound annual customer visits**

- Outlet visitors: ≈ **243,000/year**
- Nearby residents: ≈ **15,000/year**
- Staff: ≈ **27,000/year**

**Potential (optimistic) annual total:**  
**≈ 285,000 customer visits/year**.

**Average per day:**  
- 285,000 / 365 ≈ **780 visits/day**.

Realistically, if the store is medium-sized (e.g., 60–80 m²) and operations are well designed, handling **500–800 transactions/day** on peak days is feasible; sustaining ~780/day on average is ambitious but possible in a high-traffic outlet cluster with strong brand & product-market fit.

## 6. Summary: Pros & Cons of the Location (Customer Perspective)

### Pros (Quantified & Evidence-Based)

- **Strong tourism & shopping footfall**
  - Shanghai International Resort: **≈20 million tourists/year**, with Shanghai Village embedded as key component.
  - Shanghai Disneyland: **13+ million visitors/year**, many likely overlap with outlet visitors for leisure & shopping.
  - Outlet itself likely **7–9 million visitors/year**.

- **Rich overnight-stay base**
  - Estimated **4,000–6,000 overnight guests/day** within 1.5 km.
  - Adds **400–1,200 coffee-relevant tourists/day**, especially mornings & nights.

- **Good demographic fit**
  - Within 5 km: **≈219.7k residents**, with **≈72% working-age** – prime age for coffee.  
  - Local residents offer **40k–60k coffee-friendly visits/year** across all outlets, of which your shop can take a fair share.

- **Excellent accessibility**
  - 1 metro line (Line 11 Disney) + multi-bus connections.
  - Car access via resort roads and large parking lots (Disney + outlet), supporting high day-trip volumes.

- **Strong deterministic customer baseline**
  - Conservative: **≈95,000–105,000 customer visits/year** (≈260–290/day).  
  - This baseline is driven by anchor attractions, not dependent on you creating demand from scratch.

### Cons / Constraints

- **Highly seasonal & weekend-skewed**
  - Traffic strongly peaks:
    - Weekends, public holidays, summer, Golden Week.
  - Operational implications:
    - Need capacity to handle **400–800+ transactions/day** on peaks.
    - Weak off-season weekdays may be around **120–200/day** even with good performance.

- **Competition intensity**
  - Multiple existing F&B / coffee concepts inside Shanghai Village and Disney area.
  - Market-share assumptions (8–15%) depend heavily on:
    - Brand strength.
    - Location within the village (entrance vs. deep inside).
    - Differentiation (quality, seating, view, service).

- **Limited ordinary office-worker base**
  - Few regular CBD offices; main demand is tourists & leisure visitors, not everyday commuters.
  - Revenue volatility is higher than in a dense office/TOD location.

- **Reliance on resort-wide marketing & macro conditions**
  - Footfall tied to:
    - Disney’s performance.
    - Travel restrictions / macro tourism trends.
  - External shocks (e.g., epidemic policy changes) can sharply reduce visitor numbers.

## 7. Overall Assessment

- **Deterministic annual customer visits:**  
  - **≈95,000–105,000** (≈260–290/day) under conservative but realistic assumptions.

- **Potential annual customer visits with strong execution:**  
  - **≈250,000–285,000** (≈680–780/day), if:
    - Outlet footfall is closer to 9m/year.
    - Coffee category share and your store’s market share are at the higher end.

- **Main customer pillars:**
  1. **Shanghai Village outlet shoppers** (core, 70–85% of your volume).
  2. **Disney Resort tourists & resort hotel guests** (significant, especially mornings/evenings).
  3. **Local residents within 3–5 km** (stable, but smaller proportion; important for weekdays).
  4. **Resort & mall staff** (daily baseline, especially mornings & late afternoons).

The location is quantitatively strong for a coffee shop anchored in tourism and outlet retail, with clear evidence of high visitor volume. The key success factors will be brand positioning, speed & capacity on peak days, and product appeal to both tourists and nearby staff/residents.
