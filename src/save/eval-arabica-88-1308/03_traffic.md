## 1. Public transit availability

### 1.1 Metro

Within 2 km of the store, two Line 11 stations serve the resort:

- **迪士尼站 (Disney Resort, Line 11)**
  - Approx. **1.27 km walking distance** from the coffee shop (straight‑line 1.27 km; actual walk ~1.3–1.5 km via internal resort paths).
  - Typical walking time: **15–20 minutes** at 4–5 km/h.
  - Main access point for:
    - Shanghai Disneyland visitors (13M+/year in 2023).
    - A substantial share of Shanghai Village outlet visitors (7–9M/year) coming by metro.
  - Station has multiple exits (1–4) feeding into the resort promenades and shuttle/bus hubs.

- **上海国际旅游度假区站 (Shanghai International Resort, Line 11)**
  - Approx. **2.0 km** from the store (2010–2058 m to exits).
  - Role: regional metro gateway connecting to resort buses and coaches that can stop near the outlet.
  - Lower direct walk share; mainly a **transfer node** for shuttle/bus flows on 申迪东路 and other resort roads.

**Implication for your store**

- A large share of metro users will **enter the resort at Disney Resort Station**, then:
  - Walk through Disney Town / resort promenades towards the park and may later **transfer by bus / on foot** to Shanghai Village.
  - Or use shuttle buses from Disney station to outlet/bus stops on 申迪东路.
- **Reasonable direct demand pool**:
  - If even **25–35%** of outlet visitors arrive by metro → **1.8–3.15M metro‑based outlet visits/year**.
  - All of them must pass through **metro → bus/shuttle → walk** patterns that converge along 申迪东路 and resort paths.

### 1.2 Bus network

Within 2–3 km around the store, the density of bus stops is high. Key nearby ones (distance from store):

- **申迪东路购物村站 / 申迪东路购物村公交站**
  - “申迪东路购物村(公交站)” ~**321–349 m** from the store.
  - “购物村东(公交站)” ~**375 m**.
  - These are the **primary bus interfaces** for Shanghai Village.
  - Walking time to your unit: **4–6 minutes** through the outlet interior.

- **唐黄路–航城路–阳光大道 corridor**
  - Several bus stops within **360–600 m**, e.g.:
    - 唐黄路航城路(公交站) ~360 m.
    - 航城路鹿川路 / 航城路灵感街 ~512 m.
    - 航城路唐黄路(公交站) ~567 m.
  - Serve **local residents and workers** from the south and east, and some transfers from Line 11 唐黄路站.

- **Metro-linked bus stops**
  - 迪士尼地铁站(公交站) ~**1.24–1.3 km**.
  - 上海外环/旅游度假区地铁站(公交站) ~**1.95–2.1 km**.
  - Function: collect metro riders and redistribute them by bus to:
    - Shanghai Village,
    - Disney hotels,
    - nearby residential / homestay areas.

**Bus demand implication**

- Very short walking distance from the core bus stops to your shop (≤ 6 minutes), fully **inside pedestrian environment**.
- If we assume conservatively:
  - **15–25%** of outlet visitors use buses/shuttles (1.05–2.25M visits/year),
  - Nearly all will **pass within 200–400 m** of your unit when entering or exiting the outlet.

## 2. Parking availability

Within a 1.5 km radius, the area is saturated with parking, much of it directly serving Shanghai Village:

### 2.1 Immediate outlet parking (≤ 500 m)

Key facilities and distances:

- **比斯特上海购物村南地面停车场 / 度假区 P2F 南区地面停车场**
  - 167–205 m from store.
  - Multiple entries/exits located ~170–245 m from the store.
  - This is a **major car park directly serving the south side of the outlet**.

- **比斯特上海购物村 P2D/E 区地面停车场**
  - ~253–267 m.
- **比斯特上海购物村 地面停车场 (含 P2A 区, P3A 区, P3B 区)**
  - Multiple lots between **250–480 m** west/south/north of the store.
  - Entries/exits typically **250–460 m** away.

- **东区地面停车场**
  - ~532 m east of your unit.

Rough capacity estimate (industry rule‑of‑thumb):

- Visible outlet/resort surface parking fields around Shanghai Village likely total **2,500–3,500+ spaces**.
- Assuming **1.8–2.5 persons/vehicle**, that supports **4,500–8,750 people** concurrently parked, aligning with outlet peak days.

### 2.2 Wider resort parking (500–1,500 m)

- **上海迪士尼度假区 P4 地面停车场**
  - 589–724 m away.
  - Serves Disney park mainly, but some guests may walk or shuttle to the outlet.
- Numerous **hotel and homestay parking lots** (e.g., themed inns/homestays around 700–900 m).

**Parking implication**

- For **self‑drive visitors**, walking from any primary outlet parking lot to your store:
  - **3–8 minutes** on foot, all inside the resort/outlet pedestrian network.
  - No road crossings requiring signals for most routes.
- Parking is **not a bottleneck**; instead it concentrates initial footflows at **southern and eastern outlet gates**, from which guests disperse along pedestrian streets.

---

## 3. Customer flow analysis

We combine the previous customer analysis with the spatial traffic pattern.

### 3.1 Main origin groups

1. **Disney & resort tourists (domestic & international)**
   - Annual Disneyland visitors: **13M+** (2023 est.).
   - Outlet visitors: **7–9M/year**, strongly overlapping with park visitors.
   - Arrival modes:
     - Metro Line 11 → Disney Resort.
     - Tour coaches via S2 → 申迪东路 parking.
     - Private cars → resort parking complexes.
   - Typical flows:
     - Metro → Disney → **outlet** (shopping after or before park visit).
     - Hotels/homestays → outlet (shopping and meals/coffee).

2. **Regional outlet shoppers (day trips)**
   - Arrive largely by **car** or **coach** directly to outlet parking:
     - From central Shanghai via S2.
     - From nearby districts via surface roads.
   - Typical flows:
     - Parking → outlet entrance → **loop around circular outlet streets** → exit.

3. **Local residents within 5–10 km**
   - Population: **~220k (5 km)**; **~1.15M (10 km)**, but a small fraction regularly visits the outlet.
   - Prior estimate: **~165k local outlet visits/year**; **41k–58k coffee‑friendly**.
   - Arrival: mostly by **self‑drive or bus** to 申迪东路 / outlet parking.

4. **Employees**
   - Resort + mall employees: **5,000–8,000**.
   - Coffee‑buying employees: **500–1,600 per workday**.
   - Commuting patterns:
     - Metro + bus/shuttle.
     - Staff shuttles / cycling / walking from nearby dormitories or villages.

### 3.2 Internal movement & your unit’s position

The outlet is described as **circular lakeside “village” layout**:

- Your unit: **月牙畔1308**, on the lakeside promenade (“月牙畔” suggests crescent‑bay/lakeside edge).
- Main pedestrian streams:

  1. **South Gate stream (from 申迪东路 + south parking)**
     - Customers park/arrive by bus along 申迪东路.
     - Enter outlet from the **south edge**.
     - Typical movement:
       - South entrance → **inner pedestrian ring** → drift toward lakefront section.
       - Many will eventually walk near the lakeside ring for scenery, photos, and dining.

  2. **East Gate stream (from east parking / bus stops)**
     - Visitors who park in P3B/E area or come from 唐黄路 corridor.
     - Enter from **east/southeast**, then:
       - Move west along pedestrian streets that **curve towards the lakeside**.

  3. **West/Northwest stream (from Disney side)**
     - Visitors who:
       - Exit Disneyland, walk east along resort roads toward the outlet, or
       - Use hotel/resort shuttles that stop at western bus stops/parking.
     - They tend to enter from the **west/northwest** and circulate along:
       - Western front streets,
       - Lakeside promenade segments.

Within the circular design, **lakeside sections** often host:

- F&B,
- Cafes,
- Leisure seating.

So your coffee shop is likely to capture:

- Tourists seeking a **rest/view point** after walking several outlet loops.
- Guests who purposely search for **drink/dessert with lake view**.

## 4. Detour estimation & catchment (5‑min / 10‑min)

To illustrate relative locations, here is a static map centered on your store:

```markdown
![Map – Shanghai Village coffee shop location](https://restapi.amap.com/v3/staticmap?location=121.680754%2C31.13814&zoom=14&size=512%2A512&markers=mid%2C%2CA%3A121.680754%2C31.13814&key=68913ce8db83f7bbe5b4cca9720c7a8f)
```

- **A = your coffee shop in Shanghai Village** on the lakeside promenade.

### 4.1 Detour for key customer groups

1. **From main bus stops (申迪东路购物村 / 购物村东)**

- Distance to store: **~320–380 m**.
- Walking time:
  - **No detour case** (they already plan to visit outlet): your shop is simply a point along their outlet stroll.
  - Additional “off their path” detour:
    - Inside the ring, **worst case** to reach lakeside from a central path: ~100–150 m extra (1–2 min).
- **Effective detour: 0–2 minutes** beyond normal outlet route.

2. **From closest outlet parking lots (P2F / P2D/E)**

- Car to outlet entrance: 100–200 m.
- Entrance to your unit: 150–250 m via internal streets.
- Combined: **250–450 m** → **3–6 minutes** walk.
- Detour beyond “shopping loop”:
  - If a shopper already does one full or partial loop, stopping at your unit adds **≤ 2–3 minutes** of extra walking vs. any other café.

3. **From Disney Resort Metro Station (迪士尼站)**

- Disney Station to Shanghai Village main entrance: approx **1.1–1.3 km** via resort promenades → 14–18 minutes.
- Main entrance to your café: extra **150–250 m** (2–4 minutes).
- For customers **already choosing to visit the outlet**, your location vs. a central outlet café adds **≤ 3 minutes** detour.

4. **From nearby hotels/homestays (south and east)**

- Many hotels/homestays along/behind 唐黄路、南六公路、鹿川路 corridors are within **800–1,200 m** of the outlet.
- Typical door‑to‑door:
  - Walk/bike or short taxi to outlet entrance: **5–15 minutes**.
  - Outlet entrance to your unit: extra **2–4 minutes**.
- Again, **no significant extra detour** compared with any other café in the outlet.

### 4.2 5‑minute and 10‑minute “detour catchment” around your store

Focus is on customers already **inside or immediately around** the outlet.

Assume comfortable walking speed **4.5 km/h**:

- **5‑minute walking radius ≈ 375 m**.
- **10‑minute walking radius ≈ 750 m**.

Within **5‑minute (≤ 375 m)**:

- Almost entire **Shanghai Village core**:
  - All major fashion/luxury corridors.
  - South/east parking access corridors.
  - Main bus stops on 申迪东路.
- Visitor volume:
  - On a typical day with **7–9M annual visits**:
    - Daily average visitors: **~19,000–25,000/day**.
    - At any given hour (10‑hour active window): **~1,900–2,500 people on site**.
  - Within 5‑minute radius around your unit, given its central/lakeside placement:
    - Likely **60–80%** of on‑site visitors will pass within that radius at some point.
    - That is about **11,000–20,000 visit‑instances/day** in your 5‑min catchment.

Within **10‑minute (≤ 750 m)**:

- Entire Shanghai Village plus:
  - Adjacent south and east parking fields.
  - Some surrounding hotels and streets with homestays.
- This effectively covers:
  - All outlet shoppers,
  - Most staff,
  - A share of resort hotel guests walking over.
- From previous demand model:
  - Annual potential coffee visits: conservative **95k–105k**, optimistic **~285k**.
  - Nearly all of these are physically within **10‑minute detour** of your store when they are in the resort.

### 4.3 Quantitative detour impact on capture

Using previous customer model:

- **Outlet tourist/shopper coffee visits**: 70k–243k/year.
- **Residents**: 12k–15k/year.
- **Staff**: 17k–27k/year.

Given the very low incremental detour (0–3 minutes for most):

- It is reasonable to assume:
  - **70–90%** of “coffee‑inclined” outlet visitors are **within effective reach** of your unit on a typical visit.
  - Your **actual share** will then depend more on:
    - Position within the lakeside circulation,
    - Competition and signage,
    - Seating/view quality and pricing,
    - Queuing time vs. competing brands.

---

## 5. Visibility analysis

### 5.1 Macro‑visibility (outside the mall)

- The store is **inside** Shanghai Village; its direct visibility from major roads like **申迪东路** or from the S2 highway is extremely limited.
- Street‑level external visibility mainly belongs to:
  - Outlet **entrance gates**,
  - Large parking fields,
  - Signage for “上海奕欧来 / 比斯特上海购物村”.
- Consequently, your unit’s discovery is **driven by internal mall circulation**, not passing automotive traffic.

### 5.2 Internal visibility (inside Shanghai Village)

From the site description:

- Located **along a lakeside promenade** (“月牙畔”) in a **circular outlet‑village layout**.

Implications:

- **Pros**
  - Lakeside promenades in outlet villages typically attract:
    - High dwell time (photo spots, benches, F&B terraces).
    - Families resting between shopping segments.
  - People may **slow their pace** along the water, increasing:
    - Visibility time (more seconds in front of the storefront).
    - Likelihood of impulse coffee/dessert purchases.
  - Your location is likely part of a **“leisure ring”** where F&B is concentrated, rather than purely fashion corridor:
    - Higher coffee conversion per passerby than non‑food segments.

- **Cons**
  - Compared to **main entrance axes** or primary “spine” streets connecting south and east gates, your unit might be:
    - Slightly **off the fastest path** between certain car parks and specific fashion anchors.
  - Customers doing **only a short, targeted shopping trip** may:
    - Stay on the inner ring,
    - Not always reach the lakeside if pressed for time.

Approximate internal positioning effect:

- If we assume:
  - 100% of outlet visitors cross **at least one primary spine**.
  - **70–80%** of them also reach lakeside/leisure zones during their visit.
- Then your store’s frontage would be exposed to **70–80% of outlet visits** under normal circulation patterns.
  - For a mid‑range estimate at **7M visitors/year**:
    - **4.9–5.6M passer‑by impressions/year**.
  - For 9M visitors and 80%:
    - **7.2M impressions/year**.

Given typical café conversion rates inside outlets (1–3% of passers‑by purchasing):

- You’d need only **~1.5–2%** conversion of lakeside pass‑by traffic to meet the **optimistic 285k visits/year** scenario,
- Or **~0.5–0.8%** for the conservative ~100k visits/year scenario.

---

## 6. Summary – Pros and Cons in terms of traffic

### Pros

- **Strong multi‑modal access**
  - 2 Line 11 stations within **1.3–2.0 km**; direct metro → bus → outlet connections.
  - Dozens of bus stops within **2 km**, with primary outlet stops only **320–380 m** away.
- **Abundant parking extremely close**
  - Multiple large outlet parking lots within **250–500 m**, supporting **thousands of vehicles**.
  - Walking from parking to your unit generally **3–8 minutes**.
- **Minimal detour for core customers**
  - From bus stops / parking / internal streets, incremental detour to your shop is roughly **0–3 minutes**.
  - Effectively all outlet visitors and staff are within **≤10 minutes** walking radius.
- **High internal footfall environment**
  - Outlet visitors: **7–9M per year**, with prior modeling giving **95k–285k annual customer visits** for your store.
  - Lakeside promenade positioning increases **dwell time** and **coffee suitability** (resting, scenery).
- **Employee and local repeat‑traffic potential**
  - **5,000–8,000** employees and **~165k local outlet visits/year** within short ride distance.
  - Many employees will pass your area multiple times per week on foot.

### Cons

- **Low external drive‑by visibility**
  - The unit is not visible from **S2** or major city roads.
  - No spontaneous roadside stop‑in traffic; **demand relies on destination visitors**.
- **Internal location slightly off main transit axes**
  - Compared with shops right at main entrances or central plazas, some **short‑trip shoppers** may not reach lakeside zone.
  - Your effective passer‑by coverage is likely **70–80% of outlet visitors**, not 100%.
- **Seasonality and peak crowding**
  - Peak days (holidays, Golden Week, summer weekends) will see:
    - Very high flows along the promenade (400–800+ transactions/day possible),
    - But also queueing and capacity constraints that may limit capture of some potential demand.

---

### Overall traffic potential conclusion

From a traffic perspective:

- The **combination of metro, rich bus network, and large parking fields** ensures that the outlet as a whole receives high, stable inflows (~7–9M visits/year).
- Your unit’s **lakeside internal position** offers:
  - Strong exposure to **leisure‑oriented walking flows**,
  - Very low detour cost for nearly all outlet visitors and staff.
- The site’s performance will hinge more on **internal competition, brand strength, and execution** than on raw traffic availability. From an accessibility and traffic standpoint, conditions are favorable for achieving the previously modeled **260–780 transactions per day** range across the year, with pronounced holiday peaks.
