You plan to open a **coffee shop** at **申迪东路88号 比斯特上海购物村（月牙畔1308号）** in Shanghai.

This address geocodes to the **Shanghai Village (上海奕欧来 / 比斯特上海购物村)** outlet complex in **浦东新区, 上海市**, at approximately:

- **Latitude:** 31.13814  
- **Longitude:** 121.680754  

On the static map (marker **A**):

- The point lies **inside the circular outlet village** layout, close to the lakeside promenade and the inner ring of brand stores.  
- To the **north and northwest** of A, there are clustered **international fashion and lifestyle brands**, outlet shops, and internal access roads of the outlet village.  
- To the **east and northeast**, more branded retail continues, bounded further east by a **waterway/river**, indicating a scenic edge to the commercial zone.  
- To the **south and southeast**, across internal roads, the map shows **planned residential blocks and supporting facilities**, which are within a short walking distance from your intended shop unit.  
- To the **west and southwest**, the map shows **lakeside green space and residential/service buildings** around the lake, forming a mixed area of leisure and living that closely surrounds the outlet.

Your coffee shop location is therefore in a **destination shopping and leisure area**, surrounded at close walking distance by numerous brand stores, cafés, and residential neighborhoods to the south, with the lake and green spaces providing a strong leisure atmosphere.
