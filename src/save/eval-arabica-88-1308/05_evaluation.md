# Evaluation Scores

## Customer Analysis: 4.4/10
The report describes a very strong tourist and leisure node but a weak repeat commuter base, which drives the middling overall score despite impressive annual volumes. Repeat deterministic demand comes mainly from 5,000–8,000 nearby employees and a small subset of locals; based on the report’s own staff-coffee assumptions, this yields roughly 80–150 routine cups/day for this store, with most local residents visiting only a few times per year, fitting the 3.0–4.9 band for criterion 1 (scored 4.0). In the fixed 07:30–10:30 window, the outlet village is not a natural commuter funnel and Disney/outlet tourists start later, so repeat morning cups are likely under 30, placing criterion 2 in the 0.0–2.9 band (2.0). By contrast, all-day irregular leisure volumes are very high: even the conservative 95k–105k annual visits (~260–290/day) and much higher upside scenario are dominated by tourists and shoppers, supporting 150–250+ leisure cups on a typical weekday and justifying a strong 8.5 on criterion 3. The unit is on the main lakeside promenade inside the primary pedestrian loop, suggesting 25–50% of relevant mall flows may naturally pass or see the store, corresponding to “good exposure” at 8.2 for criterion 4. Total node coffee demand across all outlets is large (≈700k–1.62m coffee buyers/year, i.e., ~1,900–4,400/day average, with 3–6 competitors), making competition broadly balanced for criterion 5 (7.8), though tourist-heavy character tempers it slightly. Flow stability is moderate: Shanghai Disney and the International Resort are strong long-term anchors, but the report explicitly notes high sensitivity to tourism cycles and policy shocks, so criterion 6 is set in the neutral/uncertain range at 6.5. Demographically, the reachable users are overwhelmingly working-age tourists, shoppers, hotel guests, and resort staff in a premium outlet with high-end brands, which is a strong fit for specialty coffee, supporting 8.5 on criterion 7. Because weekday repeat flows and morning peak are structurally weak and less than half of total flows are repeat users, the global caps would limit the overall score anyway; the weighted aggregation of all criteria yields an overall customer-potential score of 4.4.

## Traffic & Accessibility: 2.9/10
The report describes a leisure/outlet setting with very strong overall visitor volumes but weak characteristics for a weekday-morning, commuter-focused coffee concept. Morning pass-by at the storefront (A) is likely very low (<1,000 7:00–10:00) because Shanghai Village is a destination outlet with traffic concentrated midday and weekends, not an AM commuter corridor, so A is scored at 1.0 and globally caps the maximum possible overall score. For those already inside the outlet, the unit is reasonably on-path with 0–3 minutes extra walking from bus stops and parking, meriting a moderate detour/path fit score (B=5.0), but this applies mostly to shoppers and staff rather than classic station→office commuters. The flow composition (C=3.0) is leisure-dominant with very limited structured morning peaks, so commuter alignment is weak. Macro transit access (D=4.0) is supported by Line 11 and a rich bus network, but the stations are 1.3–2.0 km away and most metro users need shuttles or long walks, so the project does not ‘capture’ a large rail hub in walking distance. Surrounding 1 km density (E=2.0) appears low, with ~5,000–8,000 resort/outlet workers and relatively sparse nearby residents in a resort zone. The captive same-complex base (F=3.5) is made up of outlet and adjacent resort employees—probably 1,000–2,999 people within an indoor or very short walk—but far below a true office-tower podium hub. In-project visibility (G=6.0) is decent: the lakeside promenade is a high-dwell secondary spine likely seen by a majority of outlet visitors, though not on the shortest direct line from entrances or transit to all anchors. Car and drop-off access (H=9.0) is excellent, with several thousand parking spaces within 3–8 minutes and convenient bus/taxi interfaces. Overall, despite strong destination traffic, the lack of substantial weekday-morning commuter flow and weak peak alignment drive the low composite score of 2.9 for a commuter-focused specialty coffee use case.

## Competition Analysis: 6.5/10
The report describes a very high-footfall outlet node (7–9M visits/year) and explicitly models this store’s potential at roughly 260–780 cups/day, implying a realistic sustainable volume in the mid-band (≈450–600 cups/day). This supports an Effective Node Volume score around 6.3 (upper-adequate), consistent with the rubric’s 450–599 cups/day band. On saturation, the analysis finds only three direct, strong competitors within 250 m in a massive tourist mall, and calculates that even with four coffee shops total, required coffee penetration (≈6–10% of visitors) is well below plausible 10–18% ranges; this points to healthy per-capita competition and justifies a “good” saturation score around 7.5. For positioning, the report clearly identifies multiple monetizable white spaces versus %Arabica, DOE, and Starbucks—family comfort, more seating, value pricing for staff, richer non-coffee menu, calmer lakeside environment, and overflow capture when others queue 15–25 minutes—suggesting meaningful incremental uplift beyond a generic follower, meriting a 7.5 on Positioning White Space. However, Anchor/Incumbent Risk is significant: %Arabica (premium global brand) is only 28 m away, DOE 84 m, and Starbucks 186 m on the same core flows, all with strong brand pull and digital ecosystems; the report itself notes the danger of being the “fourth choice” café, so this dimension fits an “adequate” rather than “good” range, around 5.0. Weighting these per the rubric yields a final net competitive favorability score of approximately 6.5, indicating a solid but competitive node where success depends heavily on sharp positioning and operational execution rather than untapped volume.
