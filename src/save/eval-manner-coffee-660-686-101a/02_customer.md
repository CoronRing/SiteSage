## 1. Store & Location Summary

- **Store type:** Coffee shop  
- **Planned unit:** 1F, Unit 101A, 660–686 Jiujiang Road  
- **District/area:** Huangpu District, central Shanghai  
- **Micro-location:**
  - On **Jiujiang Road**, ~50–150 m north of **East Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street** and **People’s Square commercial area**.
  - North side is **park/green space & tourist points** (People’s Park edge, scenic spots and sculptures).
  - South & west: **dense retail, hotels, office/commercial buildings**.
  - East: continuous food & beverage and shopping frontage along Jiujiang/Nanjing corridors.
- **Not inside a single shopping mall**, but **embedded in a top-tier city-center retail/tourism belt** with multiple department stores and malls in a 200–300 m range (e.g., Shanghai No.1 Department Store, New World City, Henderson/Shanghai Shimao Plaza, Raffles City People’s Square).

Given it’s a coffee shop, we focus on **300 m / 500 m / 1,000 m / 1,500 m** catchments, but population data is only available at 500 m and must be interpreted as **residential**, while a large share of customers will be **mobile (office workers, tourists, shoppers, metro passengers)**.

---

## 2. Demographics within Various Radii

We have precise WorldPop data for **500 m radius** and will infer other radii proportionally, noting that this is a dense inner-city core.

### 2.1 Population Estimates

Assuming roughly similar urban density in the central 1–1.5 km (conservative, because large parks and commercial uses slightly reduce residents):

| Radius from store | Approx. residents | Basis/remarks |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| 300 m             | ~9,000–10,000     | Scaled from 500 m; central core, but includes park and commercial land uses |
| **500 m (measured)** | **≈ 25,150**      | WorldPop estimate for 500 m radius |
| 1,000 m           | ~80,000–90,000    | Area is 4× 500 m circle; adjust downward for public spaces/roads |
| 1,500 m           | ~150,000–170,000  | Area ~9×; high-density old-city fabric but more institutional/park land |

### 2.2 Age Structure (Residential, 500 m Radius)

From WorldPop (500 m radius, total ≈ 25,150 residents):

| Age group | People (approx.) | Share of population |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------|
| 0–14      | 1,723            | 6.9%                |
| 15–59     | 17,247           | 68.6%               |
| 60–64     | 2,061            | 8.2%                |
| 65+       | 4,501            | 17.9%               |

Key implications:
- **Working-age (15–59): ~17,000** local residents within 500 m.
- Significant **senior population (~6,500)**, which may support **off-peak, daytime** coffee/tea consumption, especially if product/pricing caters to them.
- For a central business/tourist district, **actual daily mobile population (tourists, commuters, shoppers)** is far above resident counts.

## 3. Nearby Places & Customer Sources

Below is a categorized view within roughly **200–500 m** (where most daily coffee demand will originate) and within **1–1.5 km** (broader catchment).

### 3.1 Key Nearby Commercial & Office Buildings (≤ 250 m)

Likely host large daytime worker populations and ground-floor traffic.

- **Tengfei Yuanchuang Mansion (腾飞元创大厦)** – the building at or around 686 Jiujiang Road (confirmed by office leasing sites).
  - Use: **Office + retail on lower floors**.
  - Typical urban office tower of this type in Huangpu: assume **2,000–3,000 office workers**.
- **Shanghai New Asia Hotel / South New Asia Crown Holiday Hotel complex** (~80–100 m SW)
  - 4–5 star standard, large room count; assume **200–300 rooms**, **~400–600 guests** on a typical day.
  - Staff: **~150–250 employees**.
- **Ascendas Innovation Plaza / similar cowork + office facilities** (listed at 686 Jiujiang Road)
  - Multiple floors of coworking and SMEs; assume **500–1,000 desk capacity**, with **~60–80% daily occupancy** ⇒ **300–800 workers**.

Within 200–300 m radius overall:
- Likely **5–10 sizable mixed-use/office buildings** (including surrounding Nanjing East Road buildings, smaller towers, and commercial podiums).
- **Conservative estimate of office workers within 300 m:** **8,000–12,000**.

### 3.2 Major Shopping Streets & Malls (≈ 100–600 m)

The store is effectively behind or beside one of China’s busiest pedestrian shopping streets.

- **East Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street (南京东路步行街)** (approx. 100–200 m)
  - Tourist/commercial core of Shanghai.
  - Multiple sources report:
    - Typical **daily visitors** in the high **hundreds of thousands**. Widely cited ranges:
      - Off-peak weekdays: **~200,000–300,000 visitors/day**.
      - Weekends/holidays: often **>500,000**, peaking above **1,000,000** during major holidays.
  - Your site is just off this street, one block north.

- **Nearby department stores / malls within ~200–400 m** (from POI list & published guides):
  - **Shanghai No.1 Department Store (上海第一食品商店 / 第一百货, cluster)** – ~50–150 m NE/NW.
  - **New World City / New World Daimaru (新世界城/大丸百货)** – ~300–400 m W.
  - **Raffles City People’s Square (来福士广场)** – ~500–600 m SW.
  - **Shimao International Plaza / Shimao Festival City (世茂广场)** – ~400–600 m E/SE.
  - **World Union, Asia-Pacific Plaza (亚太广场)** – ~150–200 m E.
- Typical **daily mall footfall** for prime Nanjing East Road / People’s Square malls:
  - Conservative normal-day range: **50,000–100,000 visitors/mall/day**.
  - With 4–6 such malls in a 600 m radius, unique visitors will overlap, but **local area daily unique shopper/tourist count** is plausibly **300,000–400,000+**.

Your coffee shop is not inside a single mall, but sits within the **pedestrian traffic web** connecting them.

### 3.3 Hotels & Tourist Accommodation (≤ 300–500 m)

Within about 200 m (from POI data):

Examples (not exhaustive):
- **Shanghai Nanjing East Road Radisson / Jinjiang Metropolo / Holiday Inn-type hotels** (CONRAD, Yangtze, Neblina, etc.).
- Multiple **3–5 star hotels**: Conrad, Yangtze, New Asia, Grand Central, etc.
- Several **economy chains**: 如家, 汉庭, 7Days Inn, etc.

Conservative counts:
- Assume **10–15 hotels within 300–400 m**, average:
  - 150–200 rooms each → total **~2,000–3,000 rooms**.
- At 70–80% occupancy, **~1,500–2,400 guests staying overnight within 300–400 m**.
- Plus staff **~1,000–1,500** across hospitals.

Tourist guests are **high-propensity coffee buyers**, especially in mornings and late afternoons.

### 3.4 Public Transport Hubs

- **Nanjing East Road Metro Station (Lines 2 & 10)**: ~500–700 m east.
- **People’s Square Metro Station (Lines 1, 2, 8)**: ~500–800 m west/southwest.
  - Wikipedia reports **People’s Square station peak daily traffic over 700,000 passengers**.
- Several **bus stops within 50–200 m**:
  - E.g., “南京路步行街(浙江中路)” bus stops, “九江路浙江中路” etc.

While only a fraction pass directly in front of your door, integration of **two of Shanghai’s busiest metro hubs plus dense bus network** indicates substantial **commuter flow** in the immediate street grid around the store.

### 3.5 Parks, Tourist Attractions, Culture (≤ 300 m)

Within ~200 m:
- **People’s Park edge & green space**, sculptures, “immersive music drama sculpture”, **Century Square / downtown plazas**.
- **Historic spots and red tourism points**, e.g., first raising of the liberation flag, old company sites.
- These create:
  - **Daytime strolling tourists**, families.
  - **Evening leisure visitors** around Nanjing Road lighting shows.

Assume:
- **People’s Park & adjacent tourist attractions**: several **tens of thousands of visitors/day** in good weather, with peaks on weekends & holidays.

### 3.6 Residential

In the inner ring here, residential is mixed with commercial & hotels:
- **Within 500 m**:
  - ~**25,000 residents** (from WorldPop).
- Some **older neighborhoods and high-rise apartments** to the north and west; to the south, uses shift more to commercial/office/hotel.

Residential will not be the main driver, but provides:
- **Stable baseline morning and evening demand**.
- Likely skewed to **middle-aged/elderly** city-center long-term residents plus some **white-collar renters**.

## 4. Main Customer Sources & Volume Estimates

For a city-center coffee shop, we need to distinguish **deterministic (highly likely) daily reachable customers** and **potential maximum**.

### 4.1 Deterministic Daily Customer Base (Conservative)

We consider people who (a) are within an easy 2–5 minute walk of the store, and (b) have a clear reason to pass near Jiujiang Road.

1. **Office workers within 300 m**
   - Estimated **8,000–12,000 workers**.
   - Assume **60–70%** actually pass the storefront or its immediate crossroads at least once/day → **~5,000–8,000 daily “passers-by”** from offices.
   - Coffee purchase propensity (typical for Shanghai CBD):
     - Assume **5–10%** buy coffee near the office on a given day.
     - That yields **250–800 potential coffee customers/day** from office workers alone.

2. **Hotel guests within 300–400 m**
   - Overnight guests: **~1,500–2,400**.
   - Assume **40–50%** go out on foot past Jiujiang/Jiujiang–Nanjing connections (rest use in-house F&B or go other directions).
     - → **~600–1,200 passers-by/day**.
   - Coffee capture rate (hotel guests often buy coffee outside):
     - Assume **8–12%** → **~50–140 potential customers/day**.

3. **Residents within 300–500 m**
   - Residents 300–500 m roughly **10,000–25,000** (overlapping; use 500 m figure **25,000**).
   - Realistic daily “active outdoor” share (going to shops, commuting, etc.) **~50–60%** → **~12,500–15,000** leaving home.
   - Proportion whose route makes the coffee shop reasonably convenient (~15–20%) → **~1,900–3,000 daily potential passers-by**.
   - Coffee purchase rate for residents (all ages, including many seniors):
     - Assume **3–5%** → **~60–150 potential customers/day**.

4. **Nanjing East Road / nearby malls “spillover” into Jiujiang Road**
   - East Nanjing Road may see **200,000–300,000 visitors/day** on typical days.
   - But only a fraction detour to Jiujiang Road at your block.
   - Conservatively assume **5–8%** of Nanjing Road visitors enter the surrounding side streets/Jiujiang Corridor near People’s Park:
     - → **10,000–24,000 people/day** in the broader block area.
   - Those whose path gives a clear view/access to your frontage (~30–40%) → **3,000–9,600 passers-by/day**.
   - Coffee purchase rate (tourists / shoppers):
     - Assume **3–6%** → **90–580 potential customers/day**.

5. **Metro transfer/commuters**
   - People’s Square station alone: **>700,000 passengers/day** total, but most never pass your exact block.
   - Conservatively, assume your immediate Jiujiang–Zhejiang Middle Road node captures **1–2%** of all People’s Square user exits in a way that passes your store’s visual catchment:
     - ⇒ **7,000–14,000** passers-by/day potential from People’s Square.
   - Jiujiang Road is also used by part of the flow to/from Nanjing East Road and local bus stops; many of these will already be counted among office/tourist flows, so to avoid double-counting, add only **~3,000–5,000 net new passers-by/day**.
   - Coffee purchase rate: **3–5%** → **~90–250 potential customers/day**.

**Combining deterministic sources (and discounting overlap):**

Many office workers are also metro users; some tourists are hotel guests. To avoid double counting, we can:

- Sum raw potential customers/day from each source:
  - Offices: **250–800**
  - Hotels: **50–140**
  - Residents: **60–150**
  - Tourist/shoppers (Nanjing Rd spillover): **90–580**
  - Commuters (additional): **90–250**
- Raw sum = **540–1,920 potential coffee buyers/day**.

Assume **30–40% overlap** between groups (especially tourist + metro + hotels, and office + metro):

- Effective **distinct potential coffee customers/day** in front of your shop:
  - **Lower bound (after 40% overlap)**: 540 × 0.6 ≈ **325**
  - Upper bound (after 30% overlap on 1,920): 1,920 × 0.7 ≈ **1,344**

**Deterministic daily *reachable* coffee demand** (assuming reasonable product/price/visibility):
- **Estimated realistic range: 300–1,300 potential coffee purchases/day**.
- For planning, a **central reference level** of **~700–900 cups/day feasible** in a mature stage is reasonable in this environment for a well-positioned coffee concept.

This is **not** guaranteed sales, but **approximates the number of people who are both likely passers-by and plausibly purchase coffee**.

### 4.2 Potential Maximum Customer Volume

If the shop achieves strong brand recognition, good marketing, extended hours, and efficient operations, we estimate the **upper bound** of potential demand based on footfall.

Approximate **total unique daily pedestrian flow** within a 200–300 m radius of the store (overlapping but unique individuals in the vicinity):

- **Offices (8,000–12,000 daily workers)**
- **Residents & local errands (4,000–6,000 active local passers)** in the block-level streets.
- **Tourists/shoppers drawn from Nanjing Road & malls**: **~30,000–50,000** likely to pass near/around the local grid (not just Nanjing main axis).
- **Metro-linked commuters crossing the street grid**: **10,000–20,000**.

After overlap, we can conservatively say:
- Unique individuals in your **micro-area (within 200–300 m)** per day are likely at least **40,000–60,000** on standard weekdays; higher on weekends/holidays.

If we take a **coffee penetration rate** of **2–4%** of all unique pedestrians in this micro-area ultimately choosing your shop (with strong execution and limited direct competition right at your doorway):

- **Minimum potential:** 40,000 × 2% = **800 cups/day**.
- **Upper potential:** 60,000 × 4% = **2,400 cups/day**.

Given competition (numerous coffee chains and cafes exist nearby), a more realistic “maximum” for a single store on this street section might be:
- **Peak-day potential:** **1,200–1,800 cups/day**.
- **Normal good-day potential:** **700–1,200 cups/day**.

So we can frame:

- **Deterministic feasible daily sales range (steady state):** **~500–900 cups/day**.
- **Theoretical upper potential under optimal conditions:** **~1,500 cups/day**, with occasional peaks near **2,000+** during major holidays.

## 5. Summary: Pros & Cons in Terms of Customer Potential

### Pros

- **Extremely high surrounding pedestrian and visitor base**
  - Within 500–600 m: East Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street, several >50,000 visitors/day malls, People’s Square, and two major metro interchanges (one >700,000 passengers/day).
  - Micro-area unique daily pedestrians conservatively **40,000–60,000**.

- **Diversified customer mix**
  - **Office workers:** ~8,000–12,000 within 300 m, strong weekday morning & lunch demand.
  - **Tourists & shoppers:** tens of thousands daily; high beverage and snacking propensity.
  - **Hotel guests & staff:** ~1,500–2,400 guests plus >1,000 staff within 300–400 m.
  - **Residents:** ~25,000 within 500 m; stable morning & evening demand and off-peak seniors.

- **Balanced day-part opportunities**
  - **Morning:** commuters & hotel guests.
  - **Lunchtime & afternoon:** office workers and shoppers.
  - **Evenings/weekends:** tourists, shoppers, couples, families walking around Nanjing Road.

- **Street visibility and accessibility**
  - Ground-floor unit on a through street (Jiujiang Road) connecting major destinations, close to bus stops and park entrances.

### Cons

- **Intense competition**
  - Area is saturated with **existing coffee chains, bakeries, tea shops, and dessert outlets** in malls and on Nanjing Road; actual capture rate may be constrained.
  - To reach the upper potential (1,000+ cups/day), the store must differentiate on **brand, product, service speed, and design**.

- **High rental and operating costs**
  - Prime Huangpu / Nanjing East Road frontage typically has **very high rents**, requiring substantial daily volumes (often **>600–800 cups/day**) to achieve good profitability.
  - Staffing costs and long operating hours add pressure.

- **Tourism seasonality and weather dependence**
  - Tourist/shopping volumes fluctuate by season, holidays, and weather.
  - Rainy/cold days can reduce park and casual walker traffic even if local workers remain.

- **Complex traffic flows**
  - Being slightly **off** the main Nanjing pedestrian axis may require **clear signage and storefront design** to pull in part of the Nanjing Road crowd.
  - If the unit’s exact entrance is recessed or blocked visually by trees or structures, realized footfall could fall at the low end of estimates.

---

## 6. Overall Assessment

- **Residential base (500 m):** ~25,000 residents (≈17,000 working age), providing a solid baseline.
- **Mobile population:** Orders of magnitude larger — **tens of thousands** of office workers, tourists, shoppers, commuters, and hotel guests pass within a short walk daily.
- **Deterministic coffee demand (realistic)**:
  - **~300–1,300 potential purchases/day**, with a reasonable central planning range **~500–900 cups/day** after ramp-up, assuming competitive but competent operation.
- **Potential maximum (optimized store, strong brand, good execution):**
  - **Normal good days:** **700–1,200 cups/day**.
  - **Peak holidays/weekends:** up to **1,500–2,000+ cups/day** possible.

In conclusion, from a pure customer-potential perspective, **this location sits in one of Shanghai’s densest pedestrian and commercial cores** and can support a **high-volume coffee shop**. The key risk is **not insufficient customer flow**, but **competition and high occupancy cost**; achieving sustainable profitability will rely on converting a modest percentage of an extremely large passer-by base into repeat customers.
