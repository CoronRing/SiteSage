# Weighting Rationale

- **Store type:** Coffee Shop / Café on the first floor of a mixed-use/commercial building on Jiujiang Road, Shanghai.
- **Business model:** Urban, street-level café depending on frequent, repeat visits from nearby office workers, shoppers, and passersby.

- **Customer (0.31)**
  - Coffee appeals to a broad demographic, but local mix (office workers, tourists, residents) and their spending power and habits still matter.
  - Repeat visits from nearby workers and regulars are important, but not as critical as being in a high-flow location.

- **Traffic & Accessibility (0.39)**
  - Ground-floor unit on a major Shanghai street makes foot traffic and visibility central to performance.
  - High visit frequency (daily coffee runs) means convenience, walk-by exposure, and transit access are key success drivers.
  - Aligns with rubric: coffee shops are highly traffic-dependent, especially in dense urban cores.

- **Competition (0.30)**
  - Central Shanghai is likely to have many cafés, tea shops, and beverage outlets, so competitive density and differentiation matter.
  - However, even in a competitive market, a well-located site with strong traffic and a suitable customer base is more fundamental than marginal competitive differences.
  - Weight kept within the typical 0.30–0.35 range for coffee shops, slightly lower than traffic to reflect that access is the primary driver.
