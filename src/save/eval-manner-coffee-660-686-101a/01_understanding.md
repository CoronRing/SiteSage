# Understanding

The planned coffee shop is located at **上海市黄浦区九江路660-686号一层101A单元**, which geocodes to a point on Jiujiang Road in central Shanghai, near the existing POI **ELI FALAFEL黎巴嫩餐厅(九江路店)**.

- It sits in **Huangpu District**, a core urban area of Shanghai.
- The point is on **Jiujiang Road**, close to a dense commercial and leisure belt.
- To the **north**, across the main road, there is a sizable **park/green area** with multiple gates, drawing recreational visitors and families.
- To the **south and west**, there are mixed-use **commercial and office buildings**, including landmarks like a **theater** and various restaurants, hotels, and retail stores, indicating strong pedestrian flows and tourism/office demand.
- To the **east**, the corridor continues with additional restaurants and commercial premises along the same street.

The surroundings combine **shopping, leisure, and tourism functions** rather than purely residential or industrial, which is favorable for a coffee shop aiming at walk-in traffic from park visitors, office workers, shoppers, and theater-goers.
