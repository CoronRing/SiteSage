# Evaluation Scores

## Customer Analysis: 7.4/10
The report describes a classic prime CBD/tourist-core node with very strong overall pedestrian volumes but only a portion of those are stable repeat users. From its own estimates, deterministic repeat demand (office workers, commuters, nearby residents, and some hotel staff) is on the order of several hundred cups per weekday, placing it in the “strong repeat node” band, but with repeat users probably around half of all flows, so the repeat-base score is capped at 8.0. Morning-peak strength is solid but not truly prime: the store is one block off the main Nanjing East pedestrian axis and between two metro hubs rather than on top of an exit, implying a moderate 3‑hour commuter funnel (roughly 100–250 morning cups from repeat users), which fits the mid‑band at 6.5. Leisure/tourist/shopping traffic is described as exceptionally high, with tens of thousands of reachable visitors and 100–250+ incremental cups/day conceivable, justifying a strong leisure score of 8.5. Micro‑placement on Jiujiang Road gives good but not absolute exposure—on a through street connecting major destinations yet “slightly off” the main pedestrian spine and sensitive to visibility, consistent with an 8.0 for storefront integration. The analysis itself flags intense competition from many coffee and beverage concepts in surrounding malls and streets, suggesting a tight but not hopeless coffee market; given likely node demand in the low thousands of cups spread across numerous operators, a mid‑band score of 6.0 is appropriate. In contrast, long‑term stability is very high: this is an entrenched Huangpu/Nanjing East–People’s Square core with major transport and retail anchors unlikely to decline soon, warranting 9.5. Demographic fit is also excellent—large white‑collar and tourist populations, high‑end malls, and an existing coffee culture mean a high share of reachable repeat users can afford and habitually buy specialty coffee, supporting a 9.5. Weighting these criteria yields an overall customer‑potential score of 7.4, reflecting a high‑volume but competitive and commuter‑moderate location.

## Traffic & Accessibility: 6.6/10
The report describes a very strong traffic context but also makes clear that much of the volume is dispersed and not fully captive. For A, the storefront sits directly on Jiujiang Rd with bus stops 30–40 m away and 40,000–60,000 daily pedestrians in the micro-area, but with flows split among park routes, Nanjing Rd, and mall corridors, the conservative estimate of 7:00–10:00 passers-by at the actual frontage fits a ‘meaningful but not heaviest’ corridor (≈6.5). B scores high (8.5) because many key commuters (metro→nearby offices, bus riders, hotel guests) are either on-path or face ≤2–4 minutes incremental detour, with some flows having effectively zero detour from bus stops or office routes. C is commuter-strong mixed (7.0): there are 8,000–12,000 nearby office workers and large hotel staff, but the area is also heavily tourist/leisure, so peaks are meaningful yet not dominant. D is limited to 6.0 by the rubric cap: while People’s Square (>700,000/day) and Nanjing East Rd are close and multi-line, only a modest share of their huge volumes naturally walk along Jiujiang toward the store. E is very strong (9.0), with 80,000–90,000 residents within 1 km plus a dense CBD employment core, giving a very large combined base. F is weak (2.0) because, despite numerous buildings within 0–120 m, the unit is a streetfront shop rather than integrated into a single podium/tower system; the report does not support ≥1,000 truly captive workers/guests with indoor access. G is excellent (9.0) as the unit is ground-floor, street-facing on a through-traffic corridor, directly visible from named bus stops and near major landmarks, ensuring high organic discovery. H is also excellent (9.5) since there are an estimated 2,000–3,000 parking spaces within a 3–4 minute walk plus easy ride-hailing drop-off along Jiujiang and Nanjing Roads. Applying the weighted average and the global caps (notably F < 4.0 limiting the total to ≤7.0) yields a final traffic & accessibility score of 6.6.

## Competition Analysis: 6.4/10
The report describes an extremely high-traffic CBD coffee corridor around People’s Square / Nanjing East Road, with 40,000–60,000 daily pedestrians in the 200–300 m belt and strong metro/bus access, and explicitly argues that a well-positioned store could reasonably target 700–1,200 cups/day, while a generic one might only reach 200–400. Interpreting this for a realistic, decently executed but non-hero concept yields an RSV in the 450–600 band, hence an Effective Node Volume score of 6.7 (upper-adequate, not quite “strong” because of heavy competition but supported by very large flows and good micro-position on Jiujiang Road). Saturation is clearly high: within 100 m there are at least 4 major chains plus 1–2 locals, and within 300 m roughly 20–22 coffee-focused venues, with 35–45 in 500 m. However, the narrative frames this as a very dense yet still demand-driven CBD cluster rather than a visibly collapsing one; that fits the rubric’s “Adequate” band for saturation, scored at 5.2 to reflect the risk of cannibalisation without evidence of widespread weak units. The report makes a strong, specific case for several differentiation angles—park-side visibility, long-stay/work-from-café space, stronger dessert/bakery or day–night hybrid—against nearby chains that are mostly value-app (Luckin/KUDI), compact specialty (Manner), or standard third space (Starbucks). Because these niches could plausibly lift the store well above the 200–400 cup ‘generic’ outcome toward the 700+ range if executed well, Positioning White Space merits a “Good” score of 7.3. Anchor risk is meaningful: KUDI, Manner, Luckin and Starbucks are all within ~70 m on essentially the same flows, but there is no hero/flagship (e.g., Roastery) directly co-located. This matches the rubric’s “Adequate” anchor-risk band, scored at 5.0 to reflect substantial overlapping use cases without a single dominant flagship. Weighted together without any gating caps, these component scores yield a final net competitive favorability score of 6.4, indicating a high-volume but heavily contested node where success depends strongly on clear, well-executed differentiation.
