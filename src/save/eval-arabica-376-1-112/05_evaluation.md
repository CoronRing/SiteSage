# Evaluation Scores

## Customer Analysis: 5.5/10
The report describes a dense, affluent mixed residential–tourist area with strong all-day leisure flows and solid but not CBD-level repeat usage. On a conservative weekday, the store’s own estimate of 350–500 daily customers, with 35–40% residents plus additional office/school/library users, implies deterministic repeat cups in roughly the 200–300/day range, appropriate for a mid-band community node and scored at 6.2. However, the morning commuter peak is clearly not the dominant strength: the site is set inside Ferguson Lane, slightly off the main commute paths to Shanghai Library station, and the analysis emphasises afternoon and weekend strength; realistic morning-repeat cups are likely well below 100 in a 3‑hour window, justifying a limited morning funnel score of 4.0. Leisure/tourist and destination flows are a highlight: the report estimates 140–150万 annual project visitors plus substantial historic-street and library spillover, which even on weekdays can conservatively generate >100 incremental leisure cups/day, fitting a strong leisure band at 8.0. Storefront exposure is only moderate because Ferguson Lane is “藏在里弄中,” requiring intentional entry and reducing the share of total node flows naturally passing the door; a mid-band 6.0 reflects secondary-corridor placement despite decent internal project traffic. Competition is explicitly described as dense (15–30 nearby coffee/轻食 venues in the broader area), so although node demand is healthy, per-store share is tight, warranting a mid ‘tight but viable’ score of 6.0. Flow stability is strong: long-established residential density, a protected historic street, the Shanghai Library, and a known boutique commercial project provide diversified, durable anchors with mainly seasonal, not structural, volatility, supporting a stable score of 8.0. Demographic and price fit are very good: the area has a high share of working-age residents, white-collar and creative offices, visible existing coffee culture, and positioning for 40–60元客单, even though an elevated 60+ share slightly dilutes perfect fit; this merits 8.5. Aggregating these with the specified weights yields an overall score of about 5.5, below the global caps and consistent with a strong leisure-oriented, but not commuter-prime, community/tourist node.

## Traffic & Accessibility: 4.6/10
The report shows strong overall accessibility but only moderate suitability for a weekday-morning commuter-focused coffee concept. At the actual storefront (inside a courtyard/‘武康庭’ project on a side street), the primary flows are tourists and leisure visitors, with total project traffic of ~140–150万/年 but relatively weak emphasis on 07:00–10:00 commuter volumes; this supports a weak-to-moderate pass-by score (A=4.0). Path fit (B=5.5) is mixed: for武康路游客 and nearby residents walking to transit the store is near on-path or a 1–3 minute detour, but for a major potential group (地铁上海图书馆站↔图书馆刚需客) the detour is 8–9 minutes and clearly off their shortest desire line. Commuter composition (C=5.5) is balanced-to-leisure skewed: the report highlights significant tourist, library, and afternoon/ weekend traffic, with commuters only one segment among many, so the morning peak is meaningful but not dominant. Macro transit relevance is decent (D=6.0): two metro lines and dense bus coverage within 600–700 m provide a large theoretical base, but only a modest share of those flows naturally walk toward武康庭, justifying a capped moderate score. Surrounding density (E=6.0) is solid urban: ~7.75万 residents within 1 km plus 1–1.5万 workers gives a medium-to-strong base. However, captive on-site population is very limited (F=2.0):武康庭 is a ~6,700 m² boutique commercial project without large office towers or hotels feeding daily upstairs commuters, so there are likely <1,000 true captive workers/guests. In-project placement (G=6.0) is on the first floor within a small complex with decent internal exposure but not clearly on a dominant commuter spine, supporting a moderate score. Car and parking access (H=6.0) is relatively good for this context, with multiple car parks and ~300–500 spaces within a few hundred meters. The low A score (<5.0) triggers the global cap of 6.5, but the weighted average is already lower, yielding a final score of 4.6, reflecting that while the site is very good for mixed/leisure and destination traffic, it is only middling for intense weekday-morning commuter coffee demand at the door.

## Competition Analysis: 5.1/10
The analysis depicts a very strong coffee destination with substantial mixed resident–tourist–library traffic (4,000–7,000 reachable people/day) and an ambitious but plausible single-store target of 400–550 daily customers if the concept is executed well and clearly differentiated. Given the heavy fragmentation across ~45–55 coffee outlets in 1.2 km and explicit mention that many tail-end stores likely sit at 50–150 customers/day, a realistic sustainable volume for a new entrant is more in the 350–450 cups/day range, which maps to an ‘adequate’ Effective Node Volume score around 5.5. Saturation is clearly high: within ~300 m there are roughly 10–12 direct coffee competitors, in a node whose effective daily users are only in the low thousands, implying very high outlets per 10k users and fitting the ‘poor’ saturation band around 4.0. On positioning, the report is explicit that all major formats (global chains, premium specialty, indie boutiques, value chains nearby) are present within short walking distance; it nevertheless identifies some narrow but real white spaces (high-frequency neighborhood pricing/offer, reading/creative space linked to the library, and deep integration with the 武康庭 ecosystem), which are meaningful but strongly execution-dependent, so an ‘adequate’ 5.5 is appropriate. Anchor risk is high: a %Arabica unit is effectively co-located in the same complex, with Peet’s at ~56 m, PlusOne at ~100 m, and strong specialty players like Rumors and Creeper inside 300 m, meaning a hero/flagship-style brand sits on top of the node and several strong chains are nearby on the same flows, justifying a ‘poor’ anchor-risk score of 3.5. Combining these with the prescribed weights yields a final competition favorability score of about 5.1, indicating an overall adequate but challenging node where success depends heavily on standout positioning rather than inherent structural advantage.
