# Understanding

The planned coffee shop is extracted as a new store of type **coffee shop**, to be opened near the **south side of the International Port Building on Taiping Road in Shanghai**, close to the riverside. The geocoded point corresponds to **“国际港务大厦停车场”** at the intersection of **Taiping Road and Dongdaming Road**, about a short walking distance from the river.

Spatially, this location is in **Shanghai Hongkou District**, within the **Beiwaitan (North Bund)** area. Around point A, there are several large office towers and commercial buildings in all directions, a riverside promenade to the south, and residential communities a bit farther to the northwest and north. A large park with internal facilities (including a marked venue) lies to the east/northeast within walking distance. This pattern suggests a business-district setting with steady office-worker foot traffic, plus additional flow from park visitors and waterfront pedestrians.
