# Evaluation Scores

## Customer Analysis: 6.0/10
The report demonstrates a very strong overall node (large Grade A office cluster, heavy riverside leisure use, high-end hotels), but when mapped to the rubric’s narrow definition of ‘reachable’ flows it scores only moderate on the repeat base. Using the report’s own conservative weekday customer estimate (325–790/day) and the breakdown by source, repeat users (primarily nearby office workers and some residents) likely account for roughly 260–600 cups/day; assuming a typical 10% conversion, this implies only ~2,600–6,000 repeat passers within 30–40 m of the storefront, which falls into the weak repeat band on volume even though cup counts fit a higher band, hence a 4.5 for criterion 1. In the fixed 3‑hour morning peak, the promenade is not the main commuting conduit for most of the 13–16k office workers; realistic repeat cups are nearer 100–200 with perhaps 1,000–3,000 passers, placing the site at the low end of the ‘moderate’ commuter band (5.5). By contrast, the analysis shows very substantial irregular leisure potential from the riverside path, parks and ~1,300 hotel rooms, supporting roughly 55–170 incremental leisure cups on a typical weekday, so the leisure sub-score is strong (7.8). Micro-placement is excellent: the shop sits directly on the riverside pedestrian spine, intercepting the majority of flows on that segment with no detours or level changes, justifying a 9.0 for exposure. Competition is present in nearby malls and hotels (likely several chains within 800–1,000 m), but the node’s overall deterministic coffee demand is high enough that a new store can still capture healthy volumes, warranting a balanced 8.0. Node stability is strong to very strong (8.5), as North Bund is a strategic, policy-backed CBD with large, diversified office anchors and an entrenched ‘world reception room’ positioning. Demographically, the reachable base skews heavily to white-collar workers and higher-spending visitors despite a somewhat older residential population, and the surrounding tenant mix (W Hotel, Hyatt, major malls) signals solid purchasing power and coffee culture, so demographic fit is excellent (9.0). Applying rubric caps, the combined weighted average of sub-scores (1) and (2) is just over 5.0, which limits the overall score to 6.0 despite strong leisure, exposure, and demographic metrics, reflecting that this is a high-potential but not prime commuter-funnel location.

## Traffic & Accessibility: 4.6/10
The report describes a riverside, park-internal coffee site with excellent surrounding density but weak direct commuter capture. For A, the unit sits on the滨江步道, not on the metro→office desire lines, and the text frames it as a leisure/“散步” location rather than a 7–10 a.m. commuter corridor, so effective morning pass-by at 0–30 m is likely in the 1,000–3,000 range, consistent with a weak score (3.0). For B, the analysis explicitly quantifies extra walking: metro/office users add about 150–400 m and 2–5 minutes round-trip, with typical single-trip walking of 5–9 minutes from offices and 7–10 minutes from metro, which fits a moderate detour profile (6.0). For C, while the broader district is heavily office-based (13–16万白领), the report stresses that this particular site is better for “滨江散步”“休闲/社交/打卡” and weaker for “赶时间的上班族,” implying a mixed but leisure-skewed flow and only moderate peak-hour alignment (5.5). For D, there is one metro line (Line 12) within a 7–10 minute walk and strong bus coverage; however, flows must deviate into the park and are not naturally channeled past the storefront, so macro transit capture is only moderate (6.0). For E, the 1 km catchment clearly exceeds 160,000 people (13–16万 office + 5.59万 residents), satisfying the highest density band (9.5). For F, the shop is not in or under an office tower or podium—nearest offices are across main roads and park edges—so captive same-complex population is minimal (<1,000), meriting a very low score (1.0). For G, within the riverside project the unit is directly on the main promenade with long sightlines and “几乎是必经视线” for anyone on the path, justifying a strong in-project placement score (7.0), even though this does not solve the commuter-path issue. For H, the report details 2,700–3,700 parking spaces in nearby office/hotel complexes within roughly 2–5 minutes’ walk and convenient curbside/drop-off along adjacent roads, which fits the ‘excellent’ car-access band (9.0). Applying the rubric weights and the global cap for low morning pass-by (A<4), the overall commuter-focused traffic and accessibility score is 4.6/10.

## Competition Analysis: 6.6/10
The report describes a very strong macro-node (13–16k office workers ×10 = 130–160k, plus ~56k residents and substantial tourist/hotel volume), but is explicit that this site is not on the core commuter desire line and will rely mainly on off-peak/‘purpose trip’ traffic from the riverside promenade and after-work detours. The author themselves pegs a realistic target of 500–1,000 daily users if executed well, with many caveats around weather and detour time, which aligns with an RSV band around 450–700 cups/day; this supports an Effective Node Volume score of 6.7 (upper-adequate to strong). Competition density is high: about 50–55 coffee shops within 1 km and roughly 10+ within 0–400 m, including multiple Starbucks, Manner, Luckin, and others, yet the per-capita base is unusually large and the author notes that total ‘functional’ coffee capacity (2.5–4.4k cups/day) is still below theoretical demand (7.8–12.8k cups/day for office workers alone), justifying an ‘adequate’ saturation score of 5.8 rather than a harsher penalty. On positioning, the analysis clearly identifies white space for a riverside, view-led, sit-and-stay café versus nearby ‘functional’ commuter chains, but also notes that similar scenic concepts exist 700–1,000 m away on the Bund and that success is highly execution-dependent; this fits a mid-range white-space score of 6.5 (some structural gap, incremental uplift likely in the ~150–250 cups/day range vs a generic chain). Anchor risk is meaningful but not extreme: there is a standard Starbucks only 25 m away on essentially the same building cluster and a Manner at 118 m, plus rich chains within 300–400 m, yet no Reserve/hero flagship directly co-located and the intended daypart/use-case (leisurely scenic stays) is only partially overlapping the core morning-commuter role of those anchors; this supports a ‘good’ anchor-risk score of 7.5. Combining these with the rubric weights yields a final net competitive favorability score of 6.6, consistent with a high-potential but competitive, execution-sensitive scenic node rather than a guaranteed top-tier flagship opportunity.
