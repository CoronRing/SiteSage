## 1. Likely customer base & catchment radius

**Store:** Coffee shop, dine‑in + takeaway, mid‑range, in Jing’an Kerry Centre (静安嘉里中心) on Nanjing West Road, targeting office workers, shoppers, mall visitors, commuters.

**Functional catchment for a coffee shop here:**

- **Primary radius (walk‑in, high frequency):** ~300–500 m (5–7 min walk)  
  – Office workers in Jing’an Kerry Centre towers and adjacent Grade‑A offices  
  – Shoppers and visitors within the mall and surrounding retail cluster  
- **Secondary radius:** ~800–1,000 m (10–12 min walk)  
  – Additional offices, hotels, residential compounds, and students from nearby schools  
- **Tertiary radius:** up to ~2 km (occasional visitors)  
  – People coming to Jing’an Temple area for shopping, tourism, events, and transfers at the metro hub

Your most valuable daily customers will be from **inside the complex and within ~500–800 m**.

## 2. Nearby population demographics (WorldPop)

Population figures below are **residential** only and do not include commuters, shoppers, hotel guests, or tourists.

### 2.1 Population within different radii

**a) 500 m radius**

- Total residential population: **≈14,129 people**
- Age structure:
  - 0–14: **1,028** (7.3%)
  - 15–59: **8,208** (58.1%)
  - 60–64: **1,342** (9.5%)
  - 65+: **3,673** (26.0%)

**b) 1,000 m radius**

- Total residential population: **≈67,724 people**
- Age structure:
  - 0–14: **5,566** (8.2%)
  - 15–59: **39,523** (58.4%)
  - 60–64: **6,188** (9.1%)
  - 65+: **17,277** (25.5%)

**c) 2,000 m radius**

- Total residential population: **≈333,569 people**
- Age structure:
  - 0–14: **29,239** (8.8%)
  - 15–59: **194,540** (58.3%)
  - 60–64: **28,681** (8.6%)
  - 65+: **80,402** (24.1%)

### 2.2 Alignment with target customers

Your core targets (office workers, shoppers, commuters) correspond mostly to the **15–59** age band.

Approximate **absolute counts of 15–59 year olds**:

- **500 m:** ~8,200 people
- **1,000 m:** ~39,500 people
- **2,000 m:** ~194,500 people

In central Jing’an, a **large share of the 15–59 group are white‑collar workers**, often with mid‑to‑high income. In addition, much of the daytime population is **non‑resident** (commuters, shoppers, business visitors, hotel guests), which this data does not capture. It is realistic to assume that **daytime population within 500–800 m is at least 1.5–2.5× the resident count** due to offices and retail.

## 3. Nearby places & estimated customer volumes

Using nearby‑places and web search data around 31.224335, 121.450056 (~1.2 km radius). Numbers below are **reasoned estimates**, not official counts.

### 3.1 Major commercial & retail assets

**Jing’an Kerry Centre 静安嘉里中心（East / North / South malls）**

- Large integrated complex with:
  - **3 towers** (office + hotel + possibly residential/serviced apartments)
  - Podium retail (3 major zones: East, North, South)
  - Two hotels totaling **around 800 rooms** (per architectural sources)
- Reported GFA (gross floor area) of the overall complex: **≈3.74 million ft² (~347,000 m²)**.
- Composition (approx):
  - Retail mall: ~80,000–100,000 m²
  - Offices: multiple Grade‑A office towers (roughly 150,000–200,000 m²)
  - Hotels: ~800 rooms
- **Daily footfall estimate (mall area only):**
  - Weekday average: **40,000–60,000 visitors/day**  
  - Weekends & holidays: potentially **80,000–100,000+ visitors/day**
  (Based on typical footfall of major downtown Shanghai malls with this scale and metro adjacency.)

**Other Shopping & Retail Nearby (within ~500 m)**

- 静安嘉里中心东区 / 北区 / 南区商场 – you are inside this cluster.
- 新业太古汇 (HKRI Taikoo Hui) – high‑end mixed‑use mall within ~130 m.
- 久光百货 (Jiuguang Department Store) – ~370 m.
- CP静安, 上海商城, Julu758, 近邻普通商场和街区零售等。

These collectively form **one of Shanghai’s densest premium retail corridors**, supporting very high shopper and leisure traffic.

**Conservative daily shopper / leisure visitor pool within 500–800 m:**

- On a typical weekday:  
  – Jing’an Kerry Centre + Taikoo Hui + Jiuguang + CP Jing’an + streetside retail:  
  – **80,000–120,000 people/day**
- On weekends:  
  – **120,000–180,000+ people/day**

A coffee shop with good positioning and product‑market fit might realistically capture even **0.2–0.5%** of this daily flow over the day (≈160–900 transactions/day) from shoppers and leisure visitors alone, **before counting office workers and commuters**.

---

### 3.2 Offices & business population

The area is a **prime CBD node**. Not every office building appears explicitly in the POI list, but based on mapping and known assets:

- Jing’an Kerry Centre Office Towers (1, 2, 3)  
  – Likely **>150,000–200,000 m²** of office space  
  – Assume average **15–18 m²/employee** → **8,000–12,000 office workers** in this complex alone.
- Nearby Grade‑A and mixed‑use office buildings:
  - 上海悦达中广  
  - 上海88 / 上海X88  
  - 上海商城 towers  
  - Office space in HKRI Taikoo Hui, CP Jing’an, etc.
- Within **500 m radius**, reasonably:
  - **Total office workers** (including your own complex): **20,000–35,000**.
- Within **1,000 m radius**:
  - Extend to more towers east/west along Nanjing West Road and Yan’an Road.  
  - **Office workers** could reach **40,000–60,000+**.

**Coffee demand from office workers (rough estimate):**

- Suppose **25–35%** of nearby office workers are potential coffee buyers on any given weekday (one purchase/day).
- Within 500 m:  
  – Potential office coffee demand:  
  – 20,000–35,000 workers × 25–35% ≈ **5,000–12,000 coffee occasions/day** in your walkable zone.  
  Even a **1–2% share** of these occasions equates to **50–240 office‑driven transactions/day**.

---

### 3.3 Hotels, serviced apartments & tourists

Within roughly **400–500 m**, there is an exceptional density of 4–5 star hotels and serviced residences:

- 静安香格里拉大酒店 (Shangri‑La Jing’an) – inside/adjacent to Kerry; ~508+ rooms (approx).
- 上海波特曼丽思卡尔顿酒店 (Portman Ritz‑Carlton) – ~575 rooms.
- 上海宏安瑞士大酒店 (Swissotel Grand Shanghai) – ~470 rooms.
- 静安·秋果酒店, 上海明东方, 上海商城公寓、西峰公寓、东峰公寓, 佳里公寓, Serviced apartments at Shanghai Centre, etc.
- Several other upscale hotels within 400–500 m.

**Approximate room count within 500–800 m:**  
- Large hotels listed above plus smaller ones: **≈2,000–3,000 rooms**.

**Assuming:**

- Average occupancy: **70–80%**
- Average guests per occupied room: **1.3–1.6**

→ Daily in‑house guests: **≈1,800–3,800 people**.

If **15–25%** of them purchase at **external coffee shops** in/around the mall at least once per day:

- **Potential tourist/hotel coffee demand** in area:  
  – 1,800–3,800 × 15–25% ≈ **270–950 coffee occasions/day**.  
  A strong, visible coffee brand in the mall might capture **10–20%** of these → **30–190 transactions/day** from hotel guests & tourists.

---

### 3.4 Schools & students

Nearby POIs include:

- 华东模范中学东校区 (≈317 m)  
- 华东模范中学西校区 (≈428 m)
- 曼彻斯特大学中国中心 (higher education/training, ≈325 m)

These imply a **cluster of middle/high school students and adult learners**.

Estimated scale (rough but conservative):

- Each middle school campus: **800–1,200 students**. Two campuses → **1,600–2,400 students**.
- Adult learners at the Manchester China Centre likely smaller, but high coffee affinity: maybe **100–500 students/staff onsite on a typical day**.

**Potential contribution:**

- Students (especially older high school and university/adult learners) often buy drinks after school or on weekends.  
- If **10–20%** of the 2,000–2,500 learners/staff in the extended area buy coffee or beverages externally on a given day, that’s **200–500 drink occasions/day**.  
- Given you are inside the major mall node, you might reasonably attract **5–15%** of those → **10–75 transactions/day**, peaking after school hours and weekends.

---

### 3.5 Public transport & commuters

**Jing’an Temple Metro Station (静安寺站)**

- Major interchange of multiple lines (currently Lines 2, 7, and 14).  
- While the web search result didn’t give a specific daily figure, comparable Shanghai core interchanges commonly reach **300,000–400,000+ passengers/day** (all entries, exits, transfers combined).

The POI list shows multiple station entrances/exits within ~150–400 m:

- 静安寺地铁站各出入口 (3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10号口等)
- Bus stops: 延安中路铜仁路, 铜仁路南京西路, 常德路公交站, 上海展览中心站, etc.

**Commuter relevance to your shop:**

- Only a small fraction of the total station throughput naturally flows into Jing’an Kerry Centre, but:
  - Many office workers using the station work in the towers above/around the mall.
  - Evening commuters may pass through the mall, especially when connecting to bus stops/taxis or going to retail/dining.
- If even **5–10%** of total station users interact with the Kerry/Taikoo/Lujiazui retail environment (say 15,000–35,000 people/day), and **5–10%** of these buy hot/cold beverages:
  - That’s an additional **750–3,500 beverage opportunities/day** in the immediate complex.
  - Capturing **5–15%** of these opportunities could add **40–500 transactions/day**, mainly in morning and evening peaks.

---

### 3.6 Residential population in immediate surroundings

Within **500 m**, residential population ≈ **14,100**; within **1,000 m**, ≈ **67,700**.

While this is a smaller component relative to commuters and shoppers in a CBD:

- Demographics skew older than typical new districts (≈24–26% aged 65+), but still **~58% of residents in the 15–59 range**.
- In central Jing’an, many residents are **affluent or upper‑middle class**, with higher spending on dining and coffee.
- Realistic **residential coffee demand**:
  - Within 500 m, assume **2,000–3,000** residents are active café users.
  - If each buys coffee **1–3 times per week** nearby, that’s **2,000–9,000 residential coffee occasions/week**, or roughly **300–1,300 occasions/day** averaged across days of week.  
  Your shop, as one of several options, might win **10–25%** share here → **30–325 daily transactions** from local residents (more on weekends and evenings).

---

## 4. Consolidated view of customer sources

### 4.1 Main customer segments

1. **Office workers (highest frequency, most stable)**  
   - 500 m: ~20,000–35,000 office workers.  
   - Coffee occasions in area: **5,000–12,000/day**.  
   - Realistic share for your shop (depending on competition & execution): **50–240+ transactions/day**.

2. **Mall shoppers & leisure visitors (high volume, more variable)**  
   - Combined malls/retail in 500–800 m: **80,000–120,000 weekday**, up to **180,000+ weekend visitors**.  
   - Coffee occasions in area: easily **tens of thousands/day**.  
   - Reasonable capture for a single well‑positioned coffee shop: **160–900+ transactions/day**.

3. **Commuters via Jing’an Temple Station & bus hubs (peaks a.m./p.m.)**  
   - Effective Kerry/Taikoo‑area influenced commuters: maybe **15,000–35,000/day**.  
   - Coffee occasions in the cluster: **750–3,500/day**.  
   - Potential share for your shop: **40–500/day**, mostly morning & evening.

4. **Hotel guests, business travelers & tourists**  
   - ~2,000–3,000 rooms within 800 m; ~1,800–3,800 guests/day.  
   - External coffee demand: **270–950 occasions/day**.  
   - Potential capture: **30–190/day**, more on weekends, holidays, and event days.

5. **Residents & students (moderate but loyal)**  
   - Residents within 1 km: ~67,700.  
   - Local coffee occasions: **hundreds to low thousands/day** across all outlets.  
   - Your likely share: **30–325/day**, skewed to evenings/weekends.  
   - Students/learners: **200–500 drink occasions/day** in the area → **10–75/day** for your store.

### 4.2 Likely overall daily transaction potential

These segments overlap and there is strong competition, so figures are **not additive**. But they illustrate that:

- **Total coffee demand in your immediate 500–800 m catchment** is extremely high – plausibly **10,000–25,000+ beverage occasions/day across all cafés and drink outlets**.
- If your shop:  
  - Is well‑situated within the mall with good visibility to office and commuter flows,  
  - Offers competitive quality, pricing, and speed,  
  - Aligns with mall positioning (mid‑range, modern, possibly some seating + quick takeaway),

then a **steady‑state target** of roughly:

- **300–800 transactions/day on weekdays**,  
- **400–1,000+ transactions/day on weekends/holidays**

is **realistic**, assuming average competition levels for Nanjing West Road premium malls. Top‑performing brands could exceed this.

---

## 5. Age distribution vs product strategy

- **Core age band (15–59)**: ≈58% of nearby residents, and likely an even larger share of the **daytime working/visiting population**.
  - Strong alignment with coffee consumption habits.
  - Younger adults (20–40) particularly responsive to specialty drinks, seasonal beverages, and mobile ordering.
- **Older segment (60+)**: ~24–26% of residents; smaller share of office workers but visible in local streets.
  - Opportunity for **tea options, lighter/less sweet beverages, comfortable seating**, and morning quiet‑time offers.
- **Under 14**: 7–9%; not your primary buyer group, but may influence family visits (need some non‑caffeine options).

---

## 6. Main customer sources & justification

**Primary sources:**

1. **Office workers in Jing’an Kerry Centre and adjacent towers**  
   - Justification: High office density; your location is directly embedded in their daily routes (lobby, podium, and connection to station).

2. **Shoppers & leisure visitors across Kerry Centre, HKRI Taikoo Hui, Jiuguang, CP Jing’an, etc.**  
   - Justification: Extremely strong retail gravity; Nanjing West Road is a top destination for shopping and dining in Shanghai; malls are interconnected or close.

3. **Commuters using Jing’an Temple Station and surrounding bus stops**  
   - Justification: Major multi‑line interchange with high morning/evening flows; multiple exits feed directly into or beside the mall complex.

**Secondary sources:**

4. **Hotel guests & business travelers in surrounding 4–5 star hotels & serviced apartments**  
   - Justification: Dense cluster of international hotels; many guests seek quick, recognizable coffee and workspace.

5. **Nearby residents and students**  
   - Justification: ~67k residents within 1 km and multiple schools; they provide recurrent off‑peak and evening demand, especially on weekends.

---

## 7. Limitations & notes about data

- **Population data** is residential only and does **not** reflect:
  - Commuters working in nearby offices,
  - Tourists and hotel guests,
  - Shoppers who live in other districts.
- **Footfall and occupancy numbers** are **estimated** by analogy with similar‑scale Shanghai CBD malls and hotel clusters; actual counts may differ.
- **Competition** is not mapped here but is **known to be intense**:
  - Multiple international and domestic coffee chains and boutique cafés are almost certainly present within the same mall and within 300–500 m.
  - Your achievable market share depends heavily on brand strength, positioning, pricing, and exact unit position (e.g., near office tower lobby vs deep in retail corridor).

---

## 8. Summary

- The location is **top‑tier** in Shanghai’s Jing’an CBD: inside a major mixed‑use landmark (静安嘉里中心) on Nanjing West Road, directly benefiting from massive **office, retail, hotel, and metro** synergies.
- Within a **500 m radius**, there are:
  - ~14k residents (mostly working‑age adults and seniors),
  - An estimated **20–35k office workers**, 
  - Several large malls,  
  - Multiple major hotels (2,000–3,000 rooms),  
  - A multi‑line metro hub and dense bus network.
