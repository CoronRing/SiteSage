# Evaluation Scores

## Customer Analysis: 9.1/10
On population density and catchment strength, the report shows high residential counts (≈14k within 500 m; ≈67k within 1,000 m; >330k within 2 km) and then layers on very large non-resident daytime populations from offices, malls, metro, and hotels. The functional catchment is clearly defined (300–500 m primary, up to 2 km tertiary) and explicitly tied to footfall magnitudes. This easily meets the rubric’s ‘very strong catchment’ description, justifying a 9.0 for population metrics.

Demographic fit and customer behavior are both argued in depth. The 15–59 cohort dominates and is explicitly tied to white-collar, mid–high income coffee users, with multiple recurring-demand engines: 20–35k office workers within 500 m, 80–180k shoppers/leisure visitors per day in the retail cluster, a large commuter base from a 3-line metro hub, and thousands of hotel guests and students. Temporal patterns (morning commuters, lunch and afternoon office runs, evening/weekend shoppers) are mapped to realistic transaction ranges and segment shares. This matches an ‘excellent’ demographic fit and demand profile (≈9.5 for demographics/target alignment, ≈9.0 for behavior). The discussion of risks (data are estimates, competition is intense, resident base older) is present but not deeply trend-focused, so opportunities & risks land in the ‘good’ band (≈8.5). Weighting these, the overall customer potential score of 9.1 reflects an outstanding location with only modest caveats around competition and data uncertainty.

## Traffic & Accessibility: 9.5/10
For public transit and connectivity, the report documents an interchange station with three metro lines (2, 7, 14), many exits within ~150–350 m, and 8–10 bus and rapid bus stops on multiple major roads inside 400–500 m. Walking times from exits are 3–7 minutes, and the node is described as one of Shanghai’s top commercial intersections. This meets and arguably exceeds the rubric’s ‘multiple transit lines, short walking distance, high convenience’ criteria, warranting a 10.0 on transit coverage.

Walkability, parking, and road access are also very strong: mall-integrated underground parking with several hundred to 1,000+ spaces, numerous entrances within ~200 m, and clear connections from car parks, metro, and bus stops into the mall. The report notes potential micro-level weaknesses (inside-mall dependence, possible hidden locations, peak congestion), so access is rated as excellent but not perfect (≈9.0). Target customer mobility fit is almost ideal: office workers, commuters, shoppers, and hotel guests all primarily move by metro, bus, and mall-integrated parking, exactly what the site offers, justifying ≈9.5. Traffic volume and temporal benefits are described in terms of tens of thousands of daily passengers and shoppers, with well-defined peaks that match morning, lunch, and evening coffee occasions; visibility at the node level is high though micro-visibility is contingent, so this criterion scores ≈9.0. Weighting these, the overall accessibility potential merits a 9.5.

## Competition Analysis: 5.4/10
On competitor density and proximity, the report documents ≈12–14 outlets within 150 m (including Starbucks Reserve essentially co-located and Blue Bottle at 56 m), 35–45 outlets within 150–400 m, and an estimated 60–80+ within 1 km. It explicitly calls this ‘hyper-dense’ and ‘among the highest in Shanghai.’ This clearly fits the rubric’s ‘high density; competition may limit viability,’ so a low score in the ‘poor’ range (≈3.5) is appropriate.

Market saturation versus demand is also challenging: supply capacity (40–50 outlets × 150–300 cups/day) is estimated at 6,000–15,000 cups/day against 10,000–25,000 beverage occasions/day. The report concludes the market is ‘mature and near-saturated for generic coffee demand,’ with room only for differentiated concepts. That aligns more with ‘poor’ than ‘adequate’ on saturation (≈4.0). In contrast, positioning opportunity and competitive risk are treated with nuance. The analysis lays out distinct competitor archetypes and multiple white spaces—health/function focus, productivity-optimized space, localized concept, and evening socializing—demonstrating ‘some’ to ‘clear’ differentiation options (≈7.5). Competitive risk is acknowledged as high due to strong incumbents and co-located chains, but also framed as manageable if micro-location and concept are well chosen, fitting a ‘poor-to-adequate’ boundary yet leaning toward ‘poor’ risk managed by strategy; here ≈7.0 reflects that viability depends on excellent execution. Weighting these criteria (35% density, 30% saturation, 20% positioning, 15% risk) yields an overall competitive context score of 5.4: structurally difficult due to extreme clustering, but not hopeless if a sharp, well-executed niche is pursued.
