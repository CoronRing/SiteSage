## Location Traffic & Accessibility Report  
Coffee shop at Jing’an Kerry Centre (静安嘉里中心), Nanjing West Road 1515, Unit E1‑03  

---

### 1. Proximity to Public Transit

**Metro (Jing’an Temple Station 静安寺 – Lines 2, 7, 14)**  
All the following are entrances to the same large interchange station. Distances are as the crow flies; walking is slightly longer but still within 3–7 minutes.

- Closest metro exits:
  - Exit 6: 约 155 m south‑west  
  - Multiple other exits (3, 4, 8, 9, 10 etc.): 200–300 m range  
  - Main station point (“静安寺(地铁站)”): ~357 m  
- Effective walking time:
  - From nearest exit (6/8/9): ~3–4 minutes via underground mall / street level  
  - From furthest counted exits within 500 m: ~6–7 minutes  

**Bus & BRT / Express buses**

Within roughly 300–400 m you have a dense cluster of bus stops:

- 延安中路铜仁路 (Yan’an Middle Rd & Tongren Rd): ~261 m
- 铜仁路南京西路: ~291 m
- 上海展览中心 (快速公交站 – express bus): ~322 m
- 常德路 (快速公交站): ~347 m
- Multiple other stops on 北京西路 / 南京西路 / 陕西北路 within 400–500 m

These stops together serve many crosstown lines (east–west and north–south), feeding commuters and shoppers from other districts directly into the Jing’an Temple / Nanjing West Road corridor.

**Assessment for target customers**  
- **Office workers & commuters**: Direct access from Lines 2/7/14 plus dense bus network means very low friction: they already pass through/around the mall node.
- **Shoppers & mall visitors**: Many arrive by metro and surface buses, and the coffee shop is effectively “on the way” between exits and the mall’s main retail floors.

**Conclusion**:  
Transit access is **exceptional**: a multi‑line metro hub within ~200–350 m and >10 bus/express bus stops within ~500 m.

### 2. Parking Availability

Near‑site parking is heavily concentrated under the Jing’an Kerry Centre and surrounding office towers/hotels.

Within ~200 m:

- Multiple underground car parks directly under the mall and office towers:
  - 静安嘉里中心东区商场地下停车场 & its entrances (28–50 m)
  - 静安嘉里中心办公楼1座地下停车场 (34–52 m)
  - 嘉里中心地下停车场 (≈30–90 m)
  - 静安嘉里中心南区商场地下停车场 (≈85–170 m)
- Nearby independent/commercial car parks:
  - 中欣大厦立体停车场 & 中欣大厦停车场: ~139–175 m
  - Additional structured parking and hotel parking (e.g. 静安香格里拉) within 120–200 m

Functionally, this is **mall‑integrated parking** with several hundred to 1,000+ spaces across the complex and adjacent buildings.

**Implication**:  
- **Drivers** (higher‑income office workers, shoppers, hotel guests) face **minimal friction**: direct underground access into the mall and short vertical circulation to reach E1‑03.
- Good for **evening** and **weekend** coffee demand from families and leisure visitors arriving by car.

### 3. Density of Transit Options within Walking Distance

Within a **500 m radius**:

- **Metro**:
  - 1 major interchange station (静安寺) with **3 lines** (2, 7, 14).
  - Over 15 individual exits within 150–550 m of the store.
- **Bus / rapid bus stops**:
  - At least 8–10 distinct stops (standard +快速公交), covering:
    - 延安中路
    - 南京西路
    - 北京西路
    - 常德路, 铜仁路, 陕西北路
- **Parking facilities**:
  - >10 separate parking entrances/exits and structured lots identified within 200 m.
  - Multiple additional car parks within 200–600 m.

In practice, **almost every direction** (N/E/S/W) has a strong transport option feeding into this node. For a coffee shop relying on frequent, routine visits, this level of multimodal density is extremely favorable.

### 4. Detour Estimation & Flow Patterns

Below is a static map centered on the coffee shop:

![Area map](https://restapi.amap.com/v3/staticmap?location=121.450056%2C31.224335&zoom=15&size=512%2A512&markers=mid%2C%2CA%3A121.450056%2C31.224335%7Cmid%2C%2CM%3A121.4437%2C31.2232%7Cmid%2C%2CB%3A121.448%2C31.2245%7Cmid%2C%2CO%3A121.4525%2C31.2258&key=68913ce8db83f7bbe5b4cca9720c7a8f&styles=default)

- **A** – Coffee shop (Jing’an Kerry Centre)  
- **M** – Approx. Jing’an Temple & religious/tourist cluster to the west  
- **B** – Approx. core Jing’an Temple Station commercial area  
- **O** – Eastern office/retail blocks along Nanjing West Road

#### 4.1 Office worker routes

Typical patterns:

1. **Metro commuter (Lines 2/7/14) working in Kerry Centre**  
   - Route: Metro → station exit → directly into Kerry podium → office towers/mall.
   - **Detour to coffee**: Often **zero extra walking** if you locate near mall circulation or lobby paths. At most 1–2 minutes vertical or lateral detour.

2. **Metro commuter working in nearby towers (HKRI Taikoo Hui, etc.)**  
   - Usual path: Metro → street/underground corridor → their office building.  
   - Passing distance from your unit: Likely 50–150 m inside mall or via Nanjing West Road frontage.
   - **Detour**: 1–3 additional minutes, still within comfortable pre‑work or lunch detour threshold.

3. **Bus commuter on 延安中路 / 南京西路**  
   - Path: Bus stop → walk along 延安中路 or 南京西路 → offices/malls.  
   - Your shop is at the **central node**; many will walk **right by the mall entrances**.
   - **Detour**: 0–3 minutes depending on exact office location.

#### 4.2 Shoppers & mall visitors

- Already **inside the mall**, with vertical circulation funneling people through atria and corridors.
- Detour inside a mall is measured in **tens of meters, not hundreds**:
  - Even if your unit is not at the main entrance, shoppers typically accept 1–4 minutes to detour for coffee.
- For customers migrating between nearby malls (HKRI Taikoo Hui, 嘉里中心, 久光百货):
  - Walking between malls: 3–8 minutes.
  - Grabbing coffee en route adds **1–2 minutes**; very low friction.

#### 4.3 Commuters using Jing’an Temple as transfer hub

- Many riders change lines here or exit for pedestrian transfers to nearby destinations.
- Because the station concourses and underground passages connect closely to Jing’an Kerry Centre, grabbing a coffee fits naturally as:
  - A **transfer coffee** (between Lines 2, 7, 14).
  - A **“first stop” coffee** after surfacing from the metro.

**Summary of detours (one‑way):**

- Office worker in Kerry: ~0–2 minutes extra.
- Office worker within 500–800 m: ~2–5 minutes extra.
- Shopper within Kerry: essentially embedded in flow; negligible detour.
- Shopper walking between malls: +1–3 minutes.
- Bus commuter: 1–4 minutes, depending on which road and building.

This is **near‑ideal** for high‑frequency, routine coffee occasions.

### 5. Visibility Analysis

**Macro‑visibility (road network)**

- The mall fronts **Nanjing West Road (南京西路)** – one of Shanghai’s premier east–west commercial axes, with heavy pedestrian and vehicle traffic.
- To the south runs 延安中路 / Yan’an Elevated Road corridor, a major vehicular artery; while drivers see the complex at speed, the main practical visibility is for drop‑offs and passengers who then walk.

**Micro‑visibility (within and around Kerry Centre)**

- Being **inside** a high‑end mall is a double‑edged factor:
  - Exterior street‑front visibility may be limited if the unit is deep inside or on an upper level.
  - Internal visibility can be very strong if near:
    - Mall main entrances / lobby of office towers.
    - Vertical circulation nodes (escalators, elevators atrium edges).
- As unit is labeled **E1‑03**, it likely belongs to an **east zone**; this may benefit from:
  - Footfall from metro exits on the west/south feeding through corridors.
  - Flow between east retail and hotel/office block.

From a **traffic capture** standpoint:

- You benefit from the **brand and draw of Jing’an Kerry Centre** itself; visitors often explore multiple F&B options.
- With adequate signage:
  - **External signage** on Nanjing West Road and mall entrance directories.
  - **Internal wayfinding** near office tower lifts and escalators.
  
the shop can leverage both **mall traffic** and **street‑level passerby**.

### 6. Overall Accessibility Assessment

**Strengths**

- **Multi‑modal access**:
  - 3 metro lines, extremely close exits (≤200–350 m).
  - Dense bus/rapid bus network on all surrounding major roads.
  - Abundant underground and structured parking.
- **Position at a major node**:
  - Jing’an Temple / Nanjing West Road is one of Shanghai’s top commercial intersections.
  - High integration of office, retail, hotel, religious/tourism, and residential uses.
- **Short detours for key segments**:
  - Office workers: 0–5 minutes, typically.
  - Shoppers/mall visitors: negligible incremental time.
  - Commuters: 1–4 minutes depending on path.
- **All‑day, all‑week accessibility**:
  - Daytime office/commuter + evening shopping/dining + weekend family/leisure.

**Weaknesses / Risks**

- **Inside‑mall dependency**:
  - If the unit lacks façade to Nanjing West Road or key atria, you rely heavily on **internal wayfinding and tenant mix**.
  - A poor mall location (hidden corner, back corridor) would under‑utilize the superb external access.
- **Competition intensity**:
  - This node is saturated with coffee and tea brands (both chains and boutique).  
  - High accessibility benefits everyone; the fight is for **share of flow**, not just existence of flow.
- **Car access vs quick‑in‑quick‑out**:
  - Drivers must enter underground parking – good for dwell time but less ideal for ultra‑quick grab‑and‑go compared with street‑front kiosks.
- **Peak congestion**:
  - At true peaks (weekend afternoons, holiday events, temple fairs), pedestrian density may cause slight friction for in‑mall navigation, though that generally **increases** browsing and impulse coffee purchases.

### 7. Alignment with Target Customer Profile

Given the **customer analysis** and this traffic assessment, the match is very strong.

1. **Office workers**
   - Large office population in Kerry Centre and neighboring towers.
   - Extremely low detour from metro, offices, and car parks.
   - Perfect for pre‑work, mid‑morning, lunchtime and afternoon coffee runs (multiple occasions/day).

2. **Shoppers & mall visitors**
   - Kerry itself plus HKRI Taikoo Hui, 久光, CP Jing’an etc. generate **80,000–120,000 shoppers/leisure visitors on weekdays and 120,000–180,000+ on weekends** within walking distance.
   - A mid‑range coffee shop with good positioning inside Kerry taps directly into this flow, especially as a **rest / meet‑up / post‑meal** stop.

3. **Commuters**
   - Jing’an Temple station brings **tens of thousands of commuters/day** through Lines 2/7/14.
   - Short walking distances and minimal detour make it attractive for **“commute coffee”**: before work, after work, or during transfers.

4. **Mall visitors and hotel guests**
   - Multiple hotels (including high‑end) within 500 m; a portion of guests will move through Kerry.
   - For **daytime and evening** windows, hotel guests and tourists add stable incremental traffic, particularly on weekends and holidays.

5. **Price level (mid‑range)**
   - Appropriate for CBD white‑collar workers and shoppers in a high‑end mall context.
   - Matches the spending power of the catchment; accessibility ensures you are “easy choice” among comparable options.

### 8. Conclusion

From an accessibility and traffic standpoint, this is a **tier‑1, high‑potential location**:

- **Transit integration**: Elite level (multi‑line hub + dense bus grid).
- **Parking**: Ample and directly connected to the mall.
- **Detour cost**: Very low for all main customer segments.
- **Visibility**: Strong at the node level; micro‑visibility depends on in‑mall positioning and signage.

Given the already‑estimated demand of **10,000–25,000+ beverage occasions/day** in the immediate 500–800 m radius and your strong physical accessibility, your targeted throughput of **300–800 weekdays / 400–1,000+ weekends** is well supported **if**:

- The unit has decent internal visibility (near key flows), and  
- The offer and execution are competitive versus neighboring coffee and beverage brands.
