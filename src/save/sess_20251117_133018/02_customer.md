# Customer Analysis

## Population Overview
### Within 300 meters

### Within 500 meters
Expanding to a 500-meter radius, the population increases to about 16,963 individuals. This expansion includes more potential repeat customers and enhances visibility for those who may walk or travel short distances for coffee.

### Within 1000 meters
Within 1000 meters, the population grows substantially to around 76,726 people. This larger radius includes significant potential for regional marketing efforts, such as local promotions that reach a broader demographic.

### Within 1500 meters
The 1500-meter population climbs to 183,813 individuals. This wide capture radius showcases the dense urban setting of Shanghai and offers extensive market opportunities in a bustling metropolitan area.

## Age Demographics
- **Age 0-14**: This group makes up a smaller fraction with 499 in 300m, 1,523 in 500m, 7,210 in 1000m, and 17,151 in 1500m. They are not direct customers but influence family decisions, including café outings.
  
- **Age 15-59**: This category, holding the primary target group, shows 3,544 in 300m, 9,875 in 500m, 45,609 in 1000m, and 109,635 in 1500m. This includes young professionals and students, who are the café's primary target demographic for its cozy vibe and strategic pricing.

- **Age 60-64**: Secondary older demographic with 509 in 300m, 1,379 in 500m, 6,094 in 1000m, and 14,692 in 1500m. They may occasionally visit for café experiences, but are not the primary target.

- **Age 65+**: Consists of 1,488 in 300m, 3,964 in 500m, 17,312 in 1000m, and 41,229 in 1500m. This elder group may contribute to café traffic, especially in non-peak times, expanding the customer base slightly beyond the core focus.

## Customer Potential Assessment
This bustling area of Shanghai presents strong customer potential for the boutique coffee shop, especially when targeting young professionals and students. The high density of the target demographic within each radius supports the foundation for a consistent and profitable customer flow, especially during mornings when young professionals are likely pursuing coffee en route to work.

The coffee shop can expect good engagement and brand recognition given the heavy student and professional presence noted at 500m and 1000m ranges. The boutique environment combined with mid-range pricing aligns efficiently with the disposable income levels typical of the predominant age demographic (15-59).

## Data Quality & Limitations
Data is based on demographic distributions which can be prone to minor inaccuracies due to projection models and population movements over time. No specific household income data was provided which could further refine economic suitability assessments. Urban variables such as foot traffic patterns, local business competition, and infrastructure changes were not considered directly within the population data, all factors which could influence actual customer potential beyond demographic insights.
