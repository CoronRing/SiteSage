# Weighting Rationale

In determining the appropriate weights for the boutique coffee shop located at 上海徐汇区武康路376号武康庭1楼112, several factors specific to its business concept and target market were considered:

- **Customer (0.33):** Given that the shop is designed to appeal specifically to young professionals and students, ensuring that the shop's offerings match the preferences and schedules of these demographics is important. The mid-range price level also aligns well with the purchasing power of the target customers.

- **Traffic (0.42):** Being situated in a busy area like Shanghai and aiming to capture strong morning traffic, accessibility is crucial for success. The weight reflects the need for high visibility and easy access, fostering impulse visits and regular patronage by commuters.

- **Competition (0.25):** Despite the competitive landscape for coffee shops in urban settings, the focus is on the shop’s unique positioning through its cozy atmosphere and niche targeting strategy. This differentiation mitigates the impact of competition to some extent, thereby justifying a lower weight on this factor compared to customer and traffic considerations.

This weighting scheme aligns well with the key success factors for boutique coffee shops that depend on high foot traffic and a well-defined customer segment.
