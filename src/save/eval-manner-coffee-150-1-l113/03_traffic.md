## Public transit availability

**1. Metro**

- Nearest metro: **Loushanguan Road Station 娄山关路站 (Lines 2 & 15)**
  - Main station point: ≈**470 m** from the coffee shop (straight‑line), ≈**6–8 min walk** indoors/outdoors.
  - Key exits:
    - Exit 2: ≈**410 m**
    - Exit 1: ≈**414 m**
    - Exits 3 & 4: **450–625 m**
- Previously modeled station usage:
  - ≈**150,000 entries+exits per weekday**
  - Of these, ≈**4,500–7,500 passengers/day** are estimated to pass by or through the Hongqiao Nanfeng City zone.

**Implication:** The store is within one typical “commuter walking band” of the metro (≤8 min), suitable for before‑work and after‑work grab‑and‑go traffic.

---

**2. Bus network (within 800 m)**

Representative nearby bus stops and distances from the store (A):

- Zunyi Rd–Xianxia Rd 遵义路仙霞路: **291 m**
- Zunyi Rd–Tianshan Rd 遵义路天山路: **325 m**
- Tianshan Rd–Zunyi Rd 天山路遵义路: **341 m**
- Xianxia Rd–Zunyi Rd 仙霞路遵义路: **377 m**
- Zunyi South Rd–Xingyi Rd 遵义南路兴义路: **403 m**
- Loushanguan Rd–Tianshan Rd 娄山关路天山路: **398 m**
- Zhongshan West Rd–Tianshan Rd 中山西路天山路: **427 m**
- Hongqiao Development Zone 虹桥开发区: **531 m**
- Tianshan Rd–Zhongshan West Rd 天山路中山西路: **584–590 m**
- Donghua University stop 东华大学: **655 m**

This cluster indicates:
- At least **10–12 distinct bus stops** within **~650 m**.
- Likely coverage by **10+ bus routes** along Zunyi Rd, Tianshan Rd, Xianxia Rd, and Zhongshan West Rd.

**Implication:** Strong bus connectivity from both residential clusters and office/education areas; supports all‑day inflow, not only metro commuters.

## Parking availability

(Direct “parking” POI search returned mostly F&B tenants because the query area is inside a dense mall; for traffic we rely on known complex configuration and common capacity benchmarks.)

**1. On‑site parking (mall + office)**

Hongqiao Nanfeng City (north + south blocks + offices):

- GFA ≈ **277,000 m²** (≈110,000 m² mall + ≈110,000 m² offices + other)
- Typical Shanghai mixed‑use parking ratio ≈ **0.8–1.0 spaces / 100 m²** for malls + offices.
- Estimated on‑site parking capacity: **≈2,000–2,500 spaces** (all basements combined).
- Practical implication:
  - Can support **≈3,000–4,000 car trips/day** to the complex (assuming turnover 1.5–1.8x / space on weekdays).
  - Coffee shop realistically “sees” a fraction of that, but car visitors are a real secondary segment (office staff, shoppers, parents picking up kids nearby).

**2. Street / surface parking**

- Zunyi Rd is a **north–south arterial** with limited legal curb parking; most car users rely on mall and office basements.
- Short‑stay curbside or lay‑by drop‑off is possible but constrained by traffic management; rotation is high, dwell time very short.

**Implication:** For drivers, access is realistically “park once, then walk inside the mall.” The store benefits from being **1F**, but not from immediate “door‑front” parking.

---

## Customer flow analysis

Drawing on the previous customer analysis plus transport data:

### 1. Inside the mall

- Hongqiao Nanfeng City average visitors: ≈**25,000/day** (≈22,000 weekdays, ≈35,000 weekends).
- Peak recorded daily footfall: **≈92,000**.
- Being **1F indoor** in the North Block, unit L113 participates in:
  - Ground‑level circulation from Zunyi Rd entrances.
  - Internal flows between:
    - Office lobbies (north and south blocks)
    - Upper‑floor F&B
    - Retail clusters and services.

If we assume that:
- ≈**60–70%** of daily mall visitors pass through 1F main aisles,
- and **30–50%** of those pass near the unit’s immediate corridor,
then:
- **Weekday:** 22,000 × (0.6–0.7) × (0.3–0.5) ≈ **4,000–7,700 people/day** pass close enough to notice the store.
- **Weekend:** 35,000 × (0.6–0.7) × (0.3–0.5) ≈ **6,300–12,250 people/day** in near‑corridor flow.

These are people outside of office internal lifts and corridor flows.

---

### 2. Office workers

Within ≈1 km:

- Office workers: **≈17,000–23,000**.
- Many of them work **inside or adjacent to Nanfeng City**:
  - North + South Block office towers.
  - SOHO Tianshan, nearby Grade‑A/B buildings.

Typical daily flow patterns relevant to the store:

1. **Metro → office (morning):**
   - Key path: Loushanguan Rd Station exits → Tianshan Rd / Zunyi Rd sidewalks → Nanfeng offices / SOHO.
   - The North Block (store’s building) is directly on this path for:
     - Workers in Nanfeng offices.
     - A portion of workers going further east or south who cut through or alongside the mall.
   - Share of metro commuters who walk close to the store:
     - From earlier estimate: **4,500–7,500 metro users/day** pass through the Nanfeng zone.
     - A reasonable assumption: **40–60%** of them use corridors or routes that bring them within 50–80 m of the store.
     - So ≈**1,800–4,500 potential passer‑by commuters/day**.

2. **Office → lunch / afternoon coffee:**
   - Office staff in Nanfeng City and surrounding towers use the mall for lunch and breaks.
   - If **40–60%** of ≈17,000–23,000 office workers use Nanfeng or immediately adjacent retail for F&B on a given weekday:
     - That’s ≈**6,800–13,800 people/day**.
   - Share passing near this 1F unit (depending on location vs escalators and food court):
     - Assume **30–50%** cross 1F core corridors.
     - That yields ≈**2,000–6,900 office‑driven passers‑by/day** within sight of the store.

3. **Office → metro / bus (evening):**
   - Reverse of the morning pattern; similar numbers to “morning commuters”.
   - Combined morning + evening corridor expo from commuters:
     - ≈ **3,600–9,000 person‑passes/day** close to the store.

---

### 3. Residents

Catchment from previous step:

- Within 500 m: **≈25,221 residents**.
- Within 1,000 m: **≈94,000 residents**, of which ≈**62,000** are working‑age (15–59).
- Seniors 60+ within 500 m: ≈**7,370 (~29%)**.

Main flows:

1. **Residential compounds west/northwest/north of station:**
   - Example: 东南小区 and other estates along Zunyi Rd, Tianshan Rd, Xianxia Rd.
   - Path to metro:
     - Many walk **past or close to the station** first; the mall is **slightly east/southeast** from there.
     - For those going directly between home and metro, the coffee shop is a **small but clear detour**, not strictly on the shortest path (details in detour section).

2. **Residential compounds east/southeast of the mall:**
   - Some residents naturally pass the mall complex en route to the metro or bus stops on Tianshan / Zunyi.
   - For them, the mall (and thus the store) is **much closer to their direct line of travel**.

Given heavy competition and varied routes, an illustrative behavioral split:

- Residents who **regularly enter Nanfeng City** (shopping, dining, services):
  - Suppose **15–25%** of the 0–1 km residents visit the complex on an average weekday.
  - 94,000 × (0.15–0.25) ≈ **14,100–23,500 resident visits/day** across all uses.
  - Even if only **20–30%** of those traverse the North Block 1F corridors:
    - That’s ≈**2,800–7,100 resident passers‑by/day** near the store.

---

### 4. Students and hotel guests

From previous analysis:

- Students + staff within 1 km: **≈4,000–6,000**.
- Hotel guests: **≈1,000 guests/night** (8–10 hotels nearby).

Their flows:

- Students:
  - Concentrated around Donghua University and nearby campuses to the east/southeast.
  - They frequently use Tianshan Rd and Zhongshan West Rd buses/metro.
  - A portion enter Nanfeng City for meals or leisure, particularly afternoons/evenings and weekends.

- Hotel guests:
  - Heavier usage evenings and weekends, often via taxi/ride‑hailing to the mall.
  - Most hotel–mall trips are direct; the store benefits from being in a prominent 1F location where guests first enter or exit.

### 1. Commuters from metro (M) to nearby offices (O)

For offices in or attached to Nanfeng City:

- Direct path:  
  M → cross streets → enter Nanfeng → office lobby.
- Path via the coffee shop:  
  M → enter Nanfeng via same entrance → **pass 1F corridor where A is located** → office lobby.

Horizontal detour:

- **0–100 m** extra walking in most realistic paths.
- Time added: **0–1.5 minutes**.

For offices somewhat farther east/northeast (e.g., SOHO Tianshan):

- Direct route:  
  M → walk east along Tianshan Rd → office.
- Via A:  
  M → slightly southeast to A → exit/return to Tianshan Rd → office.

Additional walking:

- ≈**100–250 m** detour.
- Time added: ≈**1.5–4 minutes**.

**Within 5‑min detour band (offices):**

- 5 min at 5 km/h walking ≈ **400 m** additional distance tolerated.
- Given extra distance ≤250 m for most such commuters, the **vast majority of office workers coming via M or passing along Zunyi/Tianshan can include the store within a ≤5‑min detour**.

Given office population ≈17,000–23,000:

- Assuming **60–70%** commonly travel via paths where visiting A costs ≤5 minutes:
  - **≈10,000–16,000 office workers/day** are practically within the 5‑min detour zone.
- Those with ≤2‑min detour (essentially “on‑the‑way” inside Nanfeng or adjacent):
  - Assume **30–40%** of office workers: ≈**5,000–9,000**.

---

### 2. Commuters from metro (M) to residences (R)

For northwest / north residential compounds:

- Direct: M → exits toward north/west → enter compounds.
- Via A: M → **go east/southeast to A first** → then return past/near M → then to residence.

Detour:

- Extra path essentially forms a triangle around M.
- Additional walking estimated: **300–600 m**.
- Time added: **4–8 minutes**.

For east / southeast residential buildings:

- Direct: M → walk east on Tianshan Rd or southeast along secondary streets.
- Via A: M → dip southeast into Nanfeng to A → then rejoin direct route.

Detour:

- Added walking: **100–300 m**.
- Time added: **1.5–5 minutes**.

**Within 5‑ and 10‑minute detour bands (residents):**

Assuming typical tolerance:

- **5‑minute detour (~400–450 m)**:
  - Most residents east/southeast of M and around Nanfeng City can visit A with ≤5‑min extra time.
  - If we conservatively assume **20–25%** of the 1 km resident pool (94,000) live in these directions and have such paths:
    - 94,000 × (0.20–0.25) ≈ **18,800–23,500 residents** in the 5‑min detour band.
- **10‑minute detour (~800–900 m)**:
  - Almost all residents within 1 km technically fall within a 10‑min “out of the way” walk tolerance.
  - However, only a subset will actually make that detour regularly.
  - If **60–70%** of the 1 km residents are within a geometry where the mall is a natural node:
    - 94,000 × (0.60–0.70) ≈ **56,400–65,800 residents** potentially in 10‑min detour range.

These are *potential* visitors, not all daily; but the geometry is favorable for a large urban walk‑in base.

---

### 3. Summary of detour‑based reachable users

Within **5‑minute extra detour**:

- Office workers: ≈**10,000–16,000** primarily via M or surface routes.
- Residents: ≈**18,800–23,500**.
- Students + staff with eastward routes: assume **2,000–3,000** effectively in this band.
- Hotel guests: ≈**1,000**; almost all visits to Nanfeng involve ≤5‑min indoor detour.

Within **10‑minute extra detour**:

- Essentially the whole **94,000‑resident** 1 km ring.
- Office + student + hotel totals upwards of **22,000–30,000** additional potential regular users.

---

## Visibility analysis

### External (street‑level)

- The store is **inside** Hongqiao Nanfeng City North Block on 1F.
- The building’s **west façade** is directly along **Zunyi Rd**, a notable north–south arterial.
- However:
  - Exact unit L113 visibility to Zunyi Rd depends on façade design and whether it faces interior corridors vs exterior curtain wall.
  - If L113 mainly opens to an **internal mall corridor**, external spontaneous visibility from Zunyi Rd and passing cars/buses is **low**; discovery relies on:
    - Mall entrance visibility.
    - Signage at entrances, vertical circulation cores, and directories.

### Internal (within mall)

- 1F is typically one of the **highest‑traffic mall levels**.
- Key internal visibility drivers:
  - Proximity to main exterior entrances from Zunyi Rd / metro‑facing side.
  - Distance to main vertical circulation (escalators/elevators) connecting to food courts and offices.
  - Line‑of‑sight from major anchor tenants (e.g., supermarkets, fast fashion, lifestyle anchors).

Given the unit description (1F, North Block):

- If L113 is on a main **north–south or east–west spine** linking:
  - Zunyi Rd entrance ↔ central atrium ↔ office lobbies,
  the potential passing corridor volume is consistent with earlier estimates (≈4,000–7,700 weekday / 6,300–12,250 weekend near‑corridor passers‑by).
- If it is slightly recessed or in a side bay, internal visibility can drop significantly, even with same overall mall traffic.

---

## Summary: Pros and Cons from a traffic perspective

### Pros

- **Strong public transport access**
  - ≈**470 m** from Loushanguan Rd Metro (Lines 2 & 15), ≈**6–8 min** walk.
  - ≈**10+ bus stops** within ≈**650 m**, with dense route network.
  - ≈**4,500–7,500** metro users/day likely pass the mall zone.

- **Large, dense catchment**
  - Residents: ≈**25,221 (500 m)** and **94,000 (1 km)**.
  - Working‑age (15–59) residents: ≈**62,000** within 1 km.
  - Office workers: ≈**17,000–23,000** within 1 km.
  - Students + staff: **≈4,000–6,000**.
  - Hotels: **≈1,000 guests/night**.

- **High internal mall footfall**
  - Average ≈**25,000 visitors/day** (≈22,000 weekdays, ≈35,000 weekends).
  - Peak up to **≈92,000/day**.
  - 1F unit can see **~4,000–7,700 weekday** and **6,300–12,250 weekend** passers‑by in its corridor, assuming decent placement.

- **Low detour cost for key segments**
  - Office commuters via metro: **0–100 m** extra walk if offices are in/next to Nanfeng; **100–250 m** if farther east.
  - Many office workers and students can include a coffee stop within a **≤5‑minute** detour.
  - Residents east/southeast of the station: **100–300 m** additional walking to visit the shop on the way home or to metro.

- **Substantial 5‑ and 10‑minute detour populations**
  - 5‑min detour band: ≈**10,000–16,000 office workers** + ≈**18,800–23,500 residents** + several thousand students/hotel guests.
  - 10‑min detour band: nearly all **94,000** residents and **>20,000** workers/students.

- **Integrated mixed‑use environment**
  - Surroundings combine shopping, dining, offices, residences, and hotels.
  - Supports multi‑daypart demand: morning commute, office breaks, after‑work, weekends, and tourism/visitors.

### Cons

- **Visibility limited to internal mall circulation**
  - Being inside 1F means **little or no direct visibility** from moving cars or buses on Zunyi Rd unless the façade is directly facing the street with strong signage.
  - Customer acquisition relies heavily on:
    - Mall’s overall popularity and entrance flows.
    - Precise micro‑location vs entrances/escalators.
    - Interior wayfinding and marketing.

- **Not strictly “on the path” for many nearby residents**
  - For residents **north/west of the station**, visiting the mall requires a **300–600 m detour** (≈4–8 min).
  - Daily commute paths home→metro→work often go through the station area, not automatically through Nanfeng; the store is attractive but not inevitable.
  - Higher friction for “grab a coffee every commute” behavior among these residents compared with office workers in Nanfeng.

- **High internal competition**
  - Within immediate meters are multiple F&B and beverage brands (milk tea, desserts, existing coffee like 瑞幸咖啡, plus other chains).
  - This splits the same corridor traffic among many options; capturing share requires:
    - Clear differentiation (product, pricing, ambience).
    - Strong frontage and signage.
    - Operational excellence at peak periods.

- **Dependence on mall performance and tenant mix**
  - If the mall’s visitor count drops (e.g., anchor tenant changes, renovation, macro downturn), store traffic will be affected directly.
  - Outdoor street traffic cannot fully compensate, due to indoor location.

---

### Overall traffic suitability conclusion

From a traffic perspective, Unit L113 in Hongqiao Nanfeng City North Block is a **quantitatively strong** location for a coffee shop:

- Surrounded by **≥94,000 residents** and **≥17,000–23,000 office workers** within 1 km.
- Served by a metro station with **≈150,000 entries+exits/weekday** and dense bus coverage.
- Embedded in a mall with **≈25,000 average daily visitors**, with many customer journeys (especially office workers and some residents/students) incurring **≤5 minutes detour** to stop at the store.

The main risk is **micro‑placement and competition inside the mall**: to realize the modeled **≈475–730 orders/day** (with upside to **800–1,100/day**), the unit must be on or very near a primary 1F corridor connected to metro‑facing entrances and office flows, and must differentiate clearly among numerous nearby F&B options.
