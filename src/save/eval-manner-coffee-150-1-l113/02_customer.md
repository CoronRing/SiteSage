## 2. Demographics within Various Radii

WorldPop gives reliable data at 500 m radius around the point. For 300 m and 1,000 m we scale cautiously using typical Shanghai inner‑city densities and visible built‑up pattern (no large parks/industrial gaps).

### 2.1 500 m Radius (measured)

Tool result (WorldPop, GCJ‑02):

- **Total population (residential):** ≈ **25,221** people  
- **Age structure (absolute and %):**

| Age group | Population (500 m) | Share of total |
|-----------|--------------------|----------------|
| 0–14      | ≈ 1,689            | 6.7%           |
| 15–59     | ≈ 16,774           | 66.5%          |
| 60–64     | ≈ 2,285            | 9.1%          |
| 65+       | ≈ 5,086            | 20.2%          |

**Implications:**

- Working‑age residents (15–59): **~16,800 people** – key for commuting and weekday coffee demand.
- Seniors (60+): **~7,370 people** – more daytime leisure, but lower coffee share; some tea/dessert potential.
- Children (0–14): **limited**, but relevant to weekend family visits.

### 2.2 300 m and 1,000 m Radius (estimated)

Shanghai inner‑city often ranges **30,000–60,000 residents / km²**.  
- 500 m radius area ≈ 0.785 km² → 25,221 implies ≈ 32,000 / km² – realistic for this area.  
- The environment within 1 km is denser residential + multiple office and mall footprints. For residential **only**, we keep a conservative extrapolation.

**Approximate residential population:**

| Radius | Area (km²) | Est. residential density (/km²) | Est. population | Age 15–59 (≈66.5%) |
|--------|-----------:|---------------------------------:|----------------:|-------------------:|
| 300 m  | 0.283      | ~32,000                          | ≈ 9,000         | ≈ 6,000            |
| 500 m  | 0.785      | ~32,000 (measured)               | **25,221**      | **≈ 16,800**       |
| 1,000 m| 3.142      | assume slightly lower average ~30,000 (includes more commercial land) | ≈ 94,000 | ≈ 62,000 |

These figures are **residential only**; actual daytime population is higher due to commuters, students, and hotel guests.

## 3. Nearby Places (Key Demand Generators, within ~1 km)

Below are representative major places by category (not exhaustive).

### 3.1 Shopping Malls & Mixed‑use Complexes

(From nearby places tool and web search)

- **Hongqiao Nanfeng City – North Block (虹桥南丰城北区)** – 0–50 m  
  - Your shop’s mall; part of **Hongqiao Nanfeng City (虹桥南丰城)** complex.  
  - Project size: **total GFA 277,000 m²**, incl. **110,000 m² shopping mall + 110,000 m² office** (per Baidu Baike / Wikipedia).  
  - Position: Gubei / Hongqiao family lifestyle mall, strong F&B, children, and fashion mix.

- **Hongqiao Nanfeng City – South Block (南区)** – ~120 m  
- **Shangjia Center (尚嘉中心)** – ~270 m  
- **Baisheng Youke City Plaza (百盛优客城市广场, East & West)** – 420–540 m  
- **Jinhongqiao Mall (金虹桥商场)** – ~470 m  
- **Xinhongqiao Commercial Building / Mall (新虹桥商厦)** – ~530 m  
- **Wantdu Mall (万都商城)** – ~430 m  

These form a **multi‑mall cluster** – strong peer competition but also high aggregated pedestrian flows.

### 3.2 Offices & Business Buildings

Direct POI detail is partial, but from project description and Baike:

- Within Hongqiao Nanfeng City itself:  
  - **Three office towers (~110,000 m² of office)**, with tenants like **WPP, Pinduoduo, etc.** and occupancy ~90%.  
  - Assuming average office density of 10–12 m² per person → rough capacity **9,000–11,000 white-collar workers** in this complex alone.

- Additional office and mixed‑use in 500–1,000 m range:
  - **Tianshan Plaza / Kerry Galleria hotels & offices** nearby  
  - Various standalone office buildings along **Zunyi Road, Zhongshan West Road, and Tianshan Road**.  
  - Conservatively, additional **8,000–12,000 office workers** in 1 km.

**Conservative office working population within 1 km:**  
→ **~17,000–23,000 people**

### 3.3 Metro & Transport

- **Loushanguan Road Station (娄山关路站)** – Lines 2 & 15  
  - Exits 1/2/3/4 are **~410–620 m** from the store.  
  - Line 2 and Line 15 are both heavy‑load commuter lines.  
  - Public data by Shanghai Metro for similar interchange stations typically show **150,000–250,000 passenger entries+exits / weekday**.  
  - Conservatively assume **Loushanguan Road ~150,000 / weekday**, **100,000 / weekend day**.

Not all metro passengers pass through Nanfeng City. Based on urban layout (mall directly on one of the key walking paths to residential and offices), a **low capture** rate of **3–5%** of daily metro footfall entering the mall precinct is reasonable:  
- 150,000 × 3–5% ≈ **4,500–7,500 people/day** potentially arriving in or by the mall influenced zone.

### 3.4 Hotels

Within ~500–700 m:

- Shanghai Tianshan Plaza Hyatt / Kayue Jiayuan Hotel (上海天山广场凯悦嘉轩/凯悦嘉寓) – ~125 m  
- Hongqiao Jiating Hotel (虹桥嘉庭酒店) – ~230 m  
- Jumeirah / Lijin, Golden Tulip, etc. – 520–600+ m  
- Multiple business hotels and serviced apartments (Hanting, etc).

Assume **8–10 hotels** in 1 km radius, average **150–200 rooms**, average annual occupancy **65–70%**:  

- Rooms: 8 × 150 = 1,200 (conservative)  
- Occupied rooms: 1,200 × 0.65 ≈ 780  
- Guests: 780 × 1.3 avg persons/room ≈ **1,000 hotel guests/night** in 1 km.

Realistic share who might visit the mall and be coffee prospects: maybe **20–30%** → **200–300 potential guests/day**.

### 3.5 Schools & Higher Education

Within ~600 m:

- Several higher-education / training campuses and offices:  
  - YIWEI Management Institute (毅伟管理学院(亚洲)上海代表处) – ~114 m  
  - Shanghai Zhuanyuan Culture & Art Design Institute (上海装苑文化艺术设计学院) – ~360 m  
  - Shanghai Open University Zhongshan Campus (上海开放大学工程大中山分校) – ~380 m  
  - East China Normal University (华东师大) Yan’an Road campus extension buildings ~550–600 m  

Conservative total **on-site students + staff + frequent visitors** in 1 km:  
- **4,000–6,000 people**, with high coffee affinity among university age and faculty.

### 3.6 Residential Communities

Named or implied in data within ~1 km:

- **Dongnan Community (东南小区)** – along Zunyi Road opposite the mall  
- Multiple mid‑high–density residential communities east and south of Zunyi Road, and north toward Zhongshan West Road & Tianshan Road.  

From section 2, we estimate **~94,000 residents** within 1 km radius.

Not all are coffee shop users; we will segment in customer estimation.

## 4. Mall Footfall – Hongqiao Nanfeng City

From Baidu Baike / Zhihu article on 虹桥南丰城:

- The complex has hosted **1,800+ events**, including national IP exhibitions.
- **Single‑day peak footfall:** **92,000 visits** (“单日客流峰值达9.2万人次”).

Neither source gives an average, but using common patterns for Shanghai community/lifestyle malls:

- Peak 92,000 typically corresponds to **Golden Week/weekend/special event**.
- Regular **weekend average** often ≈ **40–60% of peak** → assume **35,000–50,000 visitors/day**.  
- Regular **weekday average** often ≈ **50–70% of weekend** → assume **20,000–30,000 visitors/day**.

To be conservative:

- **Weekday average mall footfall:** ≈ **22,000/day**  
- **Weekend average mall footfall:** ≈ **35,000/day**  
- **Annualized daily average (365 days):** ≈ **(5×22,000 + 2×35,000)/7 ≈ 25,000/day**

This is total mall visitors (all ages, repeat entries included). Your coffee shop will capture only a fraction.

---

## 5. Main Customer Sources

### 5.1 Deterministic Daily Base (People Present in Area)

These are people **physically in/around** the mall most days, regardless of whether they visit your store.

Approximate **weekday** count in 1 km:

1. **Mall visitors (entire Hongqiao Nanfeng City):**  
   - ≈ **22,000/day**

2. **Office workers (1 km radius):**  
   - Nanfeng City offices: 9,000–11,000  
   - Other nearby offices: 8,000–12,000  
   - **Total office workers:** **~17,000–23,000**  
   - Of these, those present on a given day (allowing for remote work, business travel etc.): ~85% →  
     **14,500–19,500/day** physically working.

3. **Resident adults at home / in neighborhood during day:**  
   - 1 km residents: ~94,000  
   - Working‑age (15–59): ~62,000  
   - Daytime presence (many commute out): assume 25–35% in the area during typical day →  
     ≈ **15,500–21,700/day** residents in the area at daytime.  
   - Seniors (60+ ~32,000) mostly stay nearby; assume 80% in the area during the day →  
     ≈ **25,600/day** seniors.  
   - Combined **residential daytime presence:** **~41,000–47,000 people**.

4. **Students and campus users:**  
   - Estimated **4,000–6,000** total; daytime presence ~80% →  
     **3,200–4,800/day**.

5. **Hotel guests:**  
   - As above ≈ **1,000 guests/night**, daytime in area maybe 50–60% (sightseeing, business, etc.) →  
     **500–600/day**.

These groups overlap: many office workers and residents are also part of mall traffic. So we **do not sum them**; rather, we treat mall footfall as the main “funnel” and the others as **potential repeat visitor pools**.

---

## 6. Coffee Shop Customer Number Estimation

We estimate **daily customers** for your coffee shop, distinguishing:

- **Deterministic feasible range** – cautious expectation given typical conversion rates and competition.
- **Potential maximum** – upper bound if positioning, product, and visibility are strong and competition impact is moderate.

We assume:

- There are already multiple coffee options inside Nanfeng City and surrounding malls (Starbucks, boutique cafés, bakery cafés, etc.) – we therefore use **modest conversion rates**.

### 6.1 Key Customer Pools and Conversion Assumptions

1. **Nanfeng City mall visitors**  
   - Avg daily visitors: **~25,000** (weekday+weekend mix).  
   - Typical share who might purchase from any coffee outlet in the mall: **6–10%** → 1,500–2,500 coffee purchases/day distributed among all coffee vendors.  
   - If there are, for example, **4 significant coffee competitors** in the mall (Starbucks + other chains + bakeries with coffee), an even split would be 25%; but locations with better access, sit‑down space, or unique concept may get more.  
   - For a **new normal‑positioned coffee shop**, assume **15–25%** share of total coffee orders in‑mall.

   → Your store’s mall‑based customers:  
   - Lower: 1,500 × 15% = **225 cups/day**  
   - Upper: 2,500 × 25% = **625 cups/day**  
   → **Deterministic realistic band: ~250–500 orders/day** from mall footfall.

2. **Office worker segment (1 km)**  
   - Office workers: ~17,000–23,000, present ~14,500–19,500/day.  
   - Only a portion will use Nanfeng City as their daily hub; assume **40–60%** are within convenient walking routes and actually use the mall regularly.  
     - Accessible office workers: **~6,000–11,000/day**.  
   - Daily coffee penetration (share buying at least one coffee near work): **25–35%** (Shanghai white‑collar).  
     → 6,000–11,000 × 25–35% ≈ **1,500–3,850 potential coffee customers/day** around work.  
   - Share that your shop captures (given competition across several buildings and malls): **10–18%**.

   → Office‑driven customers for your shop:  
   - Lower: 1,500 × 10% = **150/day**  
   - Upper: 3,850 × 18% ≈ **690/day**  
   → **Realistic band (overlapping with mall segment, so we discount by 30% to avoid double‑counting)**  
   - Adjusted: **~100–480 incremental office‑driven orders/day**.  

3. **Local residents (1 km)**  
   - Residential adults present in area daytime: ≈ 41,000–47,000 (incl. seniors).  
   - Practical “mall‑using resident” pool (those likely to shop/eat at Nanfeng City at least occasionally): **30–40%** → **~12,000–18,000 people**.  
   - Coffee purchase frequency from local residents (non‑office, including seniors): lower; assume **10–15%** of this pool buys coffee in/around the mall on a given day (mainly younger adults, weekend family visits).  
     → 12,000–18,000 × 10–15% ≈ **1,200–2,700 potential daily coffee customers** in the larger area.  
   - Your store capture versus all competitors (mall + nearby malls): **8–15%**.

   → Resident‑driven customers for your shop:  
   - Lower: 1,200 × 8% = **96/day**  
   - Upper: 2,700 × 15% ≈ **405/day**  
   - Deduct 30% for overlap with office/mall estimates → **~70–280 incremental resident orders/day**.

4. **Students & Training Institutions**  
   - On‑site daily presence: ~3,200–4,800.  
   - Coffee penetration among students/staff: **15–25%** → **480–1,200 potential daily coffee purchasers** in vicinity (all locations).  
   - Share to your shop: **10–20%**.

   → Student‑driven orders:  
   - 480 × 10% = **48/day**  
   - 1,200 × 20% = **240/day**  
   - After 30% overlap deduction with general mall traffic → **~35–170 incremental student orders/day**.

5. **Hotel guests & tourists**  
   - Daytime guests around: 500–600/day.  
   - Coffee purchase incidence near hotel/mall: **30–40%** → **150–240 potential buyers/day**.  
   - Share to your shop among local offerings: **15–25%**.

   → Hotel‑driven orders:  
   - Lower: 150 × 15% ≈ **23/day**  
   - Upper: 240 × 25% = **60/day**  
   → **~20–60 incremental orders/day**.

### 6.2 Synthesizing Deterministic and Potential Customer Numbers

Instead of simply adding raw maximums (which would double‑count), we integrate conservatively:

**Deterministic conservative daily customer number (average day):**

- From mall general footfall: **~250–350 orders**  
- Incremental from office focus (beyond what’s in mall general flow): **~100–150 orders**  
- Incremental from residents: **~70–120 orders**  
- Incremental from students: **~35–70 orders**  
- Incremental from hotel & others: **~20–40 orders**

→ **Total conservative deterministic range:**  
**≈ 475 – 730 customers/day**

Given typical coffee size and some snack add‑ons, this is already a viable mid‑to‑high‑volume store if operations are efficient.

**Potential (upper bound) daily customers (good execution, strong product, good location in mall):**

- Mall base at upper band: **~450–500 orders**  
- Office incremental at higher band: **~250–330 orders**  
- Residents at higher band: **~180–250 orders**  
- Students & hotel: **~150–200 orders combined**

After further 15–20% overlap reduction for optimistic scenario, the feasible **upper bound** sits around:

→ **≈ 800 – 1,100 customers/day**

This upper number would correspond to:  
- Strong brand recognition,  
- High repeat traffic from office/residents,  
- Good visibility from main internal corridors or entrances,  
- Adequate seating or fast takeaway,  
- Efficient peak‑time operations.

## 7. Summary: Pros and Cons of the Location

### Pros (Customer Potential)

- **High mall footfall baseline:**  
  - Complex peak at **92,000 visits/day**, average around **25,000/day** – large constant funnel.

- **Dense nearby population:**  
  - Within 1 km: **~94,000 residents**, with **~62,000 working‑age adults** – strong base for repeated habitual visits.

- **Significant white‑collar cluster:**  
  - Offices in and around the project support **~17,000–23,000 workers**, ideal for morning and afternoon coffee.

- **Excellent accessibility:**  
  - **Loushanguan Road Metro Station (Lines 2 & 15)** within ~400–600 m; estimated **150,000 metro passengers/weekday**, of which **4,500–7,500/day** may move through the mall area.

- **Diverse demand mix:**  
  - Families, children, students, office workers, hotel guests, and seniors create demand from **morning to evening**, not just single peaks.

- **Determined order potential:**  
  - Conservative **475–730 customers/day**,  
  - Potential up to **800–1,100 customers/day** with strong execution.

### Cons / Challenges

- **High competition for coffee and F&B:**  
  - Multiple coffee brands and beverage/F&B operators in Nanfeng City, Shangjia Center, Baisheng, and other malls within **~500 m**.  
  - Your actual share depends critically on **exact unit visibility, frontage, and differentiation**.

- **Mall‑dependent visibility:**  
  - Being inside the North Block means your performance is highly linked to **internal mall circulation**.  
  - A unit off the main circulation path, far from main entrances or escalators, may capture significantly lower share of the 25,000 daily visitors.

- **Office reliance is partly shared with other properties:**  
  - White‑collar workers have many coffee options across several nearby malls and street‐front cafés; **distance to main office towers’ exits** will affect your share.

- **Senior-heavy residential composition:**  
  - Around **29%** of the 500 m population is **60+**, a segment with **lower per‑capita coffee consumption**, so not all residential density converts to strong coffee demand.

---

## 8. Conclusion

- The location inside **Hongqiao Nanfeng City North Block** sits in a **high‑density, multi‑source catchment** with strong office, residential, and transit bases.  
- Supported by data, a **reasonable expectation** for this coffee shop is:

  - **Deterministic daily customer volume:** **~475–730**  
  - **Potential maximum daily volume (well‑executed):** **~800–1,100**

- The site is suitable for a **high‑throughput, quality‑focused coffee concept** aiming to capture:  
  - Morning & afternoon office trade,  
  - Lunch and weekend mall shoppers,  
  - Some resident and student regulars.

Success will largely depend on:
- Exact **store position inside the mall**,  
- Competing brands’ locations and strength,  
- Product differentiation and pricing,  
- Efficient handling of **peak periods** (weekday morning, lunch, and afternoon).
