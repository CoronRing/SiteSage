# Evaluation Scores

## Customer Analysis: 4.9/10
Using the rubric’s requirement to focus only on people passing within ~30–40 m of the storefront and a conservative typical weekday, the report supports a mid‑range overall score rather than a prime one. For criterion 1, although the node has a dense office and residential base and the report estimates 475–730 daily customers, once we strip out irregular mall/leisure users and infer repeat users on the actual corridor (likely a few thousand passers and roughly 150–300 deterministic repeat cups), this fits the ‘weak to lower‑moderate repeat base’ band, hence 4.5. For criterion 2, the shop is inside a mall ~400–600 m from the metro, so the 3‑hour morning window is constrained by mall opening times and indirect commuter paths; realistic morning repeat cups are in the 60–120 range with scattered flows, consistent with a ‘limited morning peak’ around 4.0. For criterion 3, weekday irregular leisure flows are meaningful at the mall level (≈22,000 visitors/day), but only a fraction pass this specific unit and much of that is repeat local use; genuinely incremental leisure passers on the corridor are likely under 3,000 with on the order of tens of cups, hence 2.5. Criterion 4 scores higher (6.5) because being on the first floor of a strong district mall implies moderate integration with internal circulation (perhaps 10–25% of relevant flows passing by) but not a dominant atrium or entrance position. Criterion 5 is relatively strong at 7.6: the analysis suggests total node coffee demand in the 1,500–3,000 cups/day range with multiple competitors across several malls; competition is heavy but still consistent with a balanced node where each operator can sustain reasonable volume. For criterion 6, the Hongqiao / Gubei sub‑CBD, with established office towers, a mature mall, and a major metro hub, yields high stability and some upside, so 8.5. Criterion 7 is also strong (8.0), as the reachable base skews to white‑collar workers, students and mid‑to‑high‑income residents despite a sizable senior share, and the surrounding tenant mix indicates solid disposable income and coffee habits. Combining these with the rubric’s weights, and observing that the relatively weak repeat and morning‑peak funnels cap the upside, produces an overall score of 4.9.

## Traffic & Accessibility: 5.4/10
The location scores as a moderate commuter-focused coffee site, with its main limitation being weak *morning* pass-by directly at the storefront. Based on the report’s own corridor estimates (≈4,000–7,700 total passers-by per weekday near the unit across the whole day), the likely 07:00–10:00 volume within 0–30 m is only in the low thousands at best, fitting the 1,000–2,999 band and justifying an A score of 3.0. Path-fit for key office commuters is strong (B=7.5): many Nanfeng office workers incur 0–100 m detour and are effectively on‑path, with a broader group within ≤5‑minute detour. The mix of flows is commuter-strong but not purely commuter-dominant (C=7.0), as the mall’s 25,000/day footfall and strong lunch/evening/weekend usage imply significant leisure share. Macro transit capture is only weak-moderate (D=4.0): although the metro station itself is large (≈150,000 entries+exits), only ≈4,500–7,500/day are estimated to pass the Nanfeng zone, keeping “relevant” volume in the sub‑30,000 range. By contrast, the surrounding 1 km density is clearly urban-core (E=8.0) with ≈94,000 residents and 17,000–23,000 office workers, and the same-complex captive base is sizable (F=7.5), as many of those workers are inside or directly attached to Hongqiao Nanfeng City. In-project visibility is judged moderate (G=6.0) because the unit is on 1F but exact placement vs the main spine is uncertain and could be a secondary corridor. Car access is excellent (H=9.0) with an estimated 2,000–2,500 basement spaces and workable drop-off. Applying the global cap for low A (<4.0) keeps the overall score in the mid-5s, yielding a final weighted score of 5.4 that reflects strong structural potential but only modest guaranteed morning storefront exposure.

## Competition Analysis: 6.6/10
The report clearly indicates a very strong-volume node inside a major mixed-use mall with high daily visitors and dense surrounding offices and residents, and it explicitly estimates conservative demand at 475–730 cups/day with an upper band of 800–1,100, implying a realistic sustainable volume in the 600+ range. This aligns with the rubric’s ‘Strong’ RSV band (600–799), supporting an Effective Node Volume score around 7.4. At the same time, competitive density is extremely high: 8–9 direct competitors within 0–100 m and about 26–32 coffee/bakery outlets within 250 m and 50–60 within 500 m, which matches the rubric’s ‘Adequate but saturated’ range (7–9 outlets within 100 m; 19–30 within 300 m) and the narrative explicitly calls the area close to saturated in pure coffee count; hence a mid-band Saturation score of 5.5 is appropriate. On positioning, the report systematically shows that major roles—value commuter (Ruixing, Kudi, BeanStar), mass specialty (Manner), global brands (Starbucks, Tim Hortons, Peet’s, M Stand), and bakery cafés—are all present on the same flows, but it also identifies some credible but execution-dependent white space around ambiance, comfortable sit-down, dessert + coffee, and broader tea/non-coffee offerings; this fits the rubric’s ‘Adequate’ white space band with incremental potential in the ~150–250 cups/day range, justifying a 6.0. Anchor and incumbent risk is clearly high: multiple top-tier chains (Ruixing at ~4 m, Kudi at ~17 m, Manner and BeanStar within ~50 m, and Starbucks/Peet’s/M Stand/Tim Hortons within ~200 m) share the same internal mall flows and heavily use digital promotions, which corresponds to the rubric’s ‘Poor’ range (≥4 strong chains within 50 m or ≥7 within 100 m on the same flows), warranting a low score of 3.8. Combining these with the specified weights yields a final competition & node potential score of 6.6, reflecting a high-volume but heavily contested node where success depends on strong differentiation rather than raw traffic alone.
