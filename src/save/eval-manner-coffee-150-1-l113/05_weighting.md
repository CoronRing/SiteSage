# Weighting Rationale

- **Store type & context**
  - Coffee shop / café located **inside Hongqiao Nanfeng City North Block**, 1st floor.
  - Mall/complex environment in a dense Shanghai commercial area (Hongqiao), likely with strong office, retail, and transit-driven flows.

- **Traffic & Accessibility – 0.38**
  - Mall-based coffee shops depend heavily on **internal foot traffic**, corridor visibility, and proximity to entrances, escalators, and transit access.
  - Many visits are **impulse or convenience-driven** (grab-and-go, between shopping, before/after work), so being easy to reach within the mall is critical.
  - Justifies a higher weight within the coffee shop guideline range (0.35–0.40).

- **Customer (Population/Demographics) – 0.31**
  - Coffee has **broad demographic appeal**, but this location likely serves:
    - Office workers and business travelers in the Hongqiao area.
    - Shoppers and families visiting the mall.
  - Understanding **income levels, work schedules, and visit patterns** (weekday vs weekend, daytime vs evening) is important for sizing demand and tailoring offer, but less decisive than raw traffic volume and convenience.
  - Hence a moderate weight consistent with coffee shop guidance (0.30–0.33).

- **Competition – 0.31**
  - Shanghai malls typically host **multiple beverage and café options** (local and international chains, tea shops, dessert shops), creating a **competitive, low-switching-cost** environment.
  - Need to assess both **direct coffee competitors** and **substitute beverage/dessert concepts** within the same mall and nearby streets.
  - Competition is therefore meaningful but not more critical than securing a strong traffic position, so it is set at a moderate level within the 0.30–0.35 range.

- **Overall balance**
  - Weights sum to 1.0 and align with coffee shop norms:
    - Traffic & accessibility is **most important** due to mall and commuter context.
    - Customer and competition are **roughly equal and secondary**, reflecting broad appeal but competitive mall dynamics.
