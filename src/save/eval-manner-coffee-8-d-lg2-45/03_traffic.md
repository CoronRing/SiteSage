### 1. Public transit availability

**1.1 Metro**

- **Lujiazui Station (陆家嘴站, Line 2)**
  - Main station body is ~**380–420 m** north–northeast of the store location (measured to station POI).
  - Multiple exits within **40–170 m** of the mall’s south side:
    - Exit 9A: 31.234491, 121.502714 – **≈43 m** from store point.
    - Exit 10: 31.234945, 121.502438 – **≈45 m**.
    - Exit 9B: 31.234302, 121.502181 – **≈91 m**.
    - Exit 8: 31.235077, 121.503475 – **≈60 m**.
    - Exit 7: 31.236307, 121.503222 – **≈165 m**.
  - The mall B1/B2 is directly connected to the **station concourse**; practical walking from platform to B2 coffee shop is roughly:
    - Platform → concourse/IFC connection: 2–4 minutes.
    - Concourse → LG2-45 (within IFC): 1–2 minutes.
    - **Total: ≈3–6 minutes one way** for metro passengers.

- **Metro passenger volume (from previous analysis)**
  - Lujiazui Station: conservative **>100,000 entries/exits/day**.
  - Reasonable assumption: **50–60%** of these passengers use south-side exits or IFC-linked passages ⇒ **50,000–60,000 pax/day** have a natural path through/adjacent to IFC’s B1/B2.

**1.2 Bus**

Within **400 m** of the store:

- Key nearby bus stops and distances:
  - 花园石桥路银城中路站 – **33 m**.
  - 陆家嘴环路花园石桥路站 – **168 m**.
  - 陆家嘴环路银城中路站 – **193 m**.
  - Additional stops on 花园石桥路, 东泰路, 陆家嘴环路 within **200–380 m**.
- Each stop typically hosts **3–6 lines** in this district; combined bus throughput is easily **tens of thousands of boardings/alightings per weekday** in the 400 m radius.
- Many bus users are shorter-distance commuters from nearby residential pockets on both Puxi and Pudong sides, feeding the same office-worker segment.

**Transit takeaway:**  
- Within a **200 m** straight-line radius of the store there are **>10 metro exits** and bus stops.  
- A substantial part of the **100k+/day** station traffic and dense bus flows physically passes IFC’s basement or its immediate perimeter.

### 2. Parking availability

Within **600 m** of the store, there is a dense cluster of structured parking:

- **IFC Mall / hotel parking**
  - 上海国金中心商场地下停车场 (IFC mall parking) entrances:
    - Closest entrance: **88–94 m** away.
    - Additional IFC underground parking: ~**153 m** away.
  - Shanghai Pudong Ritz‑Carlton and serviced apartments:
    - Multiple underground entrances within **87–101 m**.
  - These combined typically supply **>1,000 spaces** (IFC + hotel + serviced apartments; based on similar CBD complexes of comparable size).

- **Surrounding office tower parking (within ~200 m)**
  - 太平金融大厦停车场 & 地下停车场 – **104–117 m**.
  - 东亚银行金融大厦停车场 – **103–137 m**.
  - 东方汇经中心地下车库 – entrances around **141–152 m**.
  - 金茂大厦、上海中心等 own their larger parking pools slightly further (≈400–600 m).

- **On‑street / roadside**
  - 银城中路–路侧停车位 – **119 m** from the store.

**Parking takeaway:**

- Within **200 m** of the shop there are **>10 distinct parking facilities**.
- Realistic combined **parking capacity in 600 m radius** is on the order of **3,000–5,000 spaces**, dominated by office towers and mall garages.
- For a coffee shop, even capturing **1–2%** of car users as incidental customers supports strong off‑peak and weekend volumes.

---

### 3. Customer flow analysis

Using the previous customer analysis and the new transit/parking data:

#### 3.1 Key customer pools

- **Office workers (primary)**
  - ~**125,000** office workers within **800 m** of the store.
  - ~**24,000** workers in IFC & directly adjacent towers, most using:
    - Lujiazui Metro Station → IFC/lobby.
    - Nearby bus stops → short walk through/around IFC.
  - Typical daily coffee‑relevant passes:
    - 2 directional commutes + 1–2 intra‑day mall trips (coffee, lunch, errands).
    - Even if only **40%** of the **24,000** directly adjacent workers pass IFC B2 **twice per weekday**, that is **≈19,200 daily passes** from this core group alone.

- **Mall shoppers**
  - IFC average footfall: **≈45,000 visitors/day**, up to **80,000–100,000** on weekends/holidays.
  - B2 is directly tied to metro and supermarket/fast‑casual cluster; typical share of mall visitors using B2 at least once:
    - Assume **60–75%** ⇒ **27,000–34,000** B2 visitors/day on weekdays.
  - Coffee shop in LG2 corridor will be visible to a significant portion of this stream.

- **Metro passengers (through‑traffic)**
  - Of the **100,000+** station entries/exits:
    - Suppose **30–40%** actually use IFC‑linked passages or walk right by IFC’s basement corridors: **30,000–40,000 pax/day**.
    - Overlap is high with office workers and mall visitors, but this confirms heavy **“transit corridor”** flows at B2 level.

- **Tourists & hotel guests**
  - Nearby landmarks (within ~800 m walking):
    - Oriental Pearl, Jin Mao, SWFC, Shanghai Tower, Lujiazui Central Green.
  - Multiple 4–5 star hotels (Ritz‑Carlton IFC, Park Hyatt, J‑Hotel, etc.) nearby.
  - Many tourists use Lujiazui station and pass through IFC for F&B or climate‑controlled access.
  - Even if only **5–10%** of landmark visitors pass IFC, this is a reliable additional flow on weekends and holidays.

- **Nearby residents (secondary)**
  - **4,794 residents** within **300 m**; **12,432 within 500 m**; **41,603 within 1 km**.
  - With **≈66% aged 15–59**, that is:
    - ≈**3,165** working‑age residents (300 m).
    - ≈**8,200** working‑age residents (500 m).
  - These are likely to frequent IFC for weekday commuting, evening dining, and weekend shopping.

#### 3.2 Typical movement patterns

- **Metro → Office Towers (AM)**
  - Flow: Line 2 platform → IFC/B2 → escalators/lifts to:
    - IFC office towers above.
    - Southward to Taiping Finance and nearby towers.
    - Westward via mall exits towards towers over Century Avenue/Yincheng Middle Road.
  - The store is **in the direct vertical/horizontal path** from metro to several tower lobbies.

- **Office → Mall (Lunch & PM)**
  - Flow: Office towers → IFC B1/B2 F&B zones for quick meals and coffee.
  - High intensity **11:30–14:00**, with concentrated lines at coffee/bakery counters.

- **Tourists/Visitors**
  - Flow: Lujiazui station → IFC → orientation / quick refreshment → walk to landmarks; return path often retraces through IFC.

- **Car users**
  - Flow: Enter IFC or nearby garage → elevator to mall levels or tower podiums → pass through B2 connection areas.

**Flow implication:**  
At peak times, the corridor near LG2‑45 will see **continuous two‑way streams** of commuters and shoppers. Given overlapping pools, it’s realistic that **10,000–20,000 individual people/day** will be within **10–20 m line‑of‑sight** of the store frontage, assuming good corridor positioning.

### 4. Detour estimation & catchment

#### 4.1 Static map (relative positions)

Static map (A = IFC mall / store location; approximated landmarks):

- **A**: Store/IFC  
- **L**: Lujiazui central roundabout & metro concourse area (north‑northwest).  
- **J**: Jin Mao / top landmark cluster (northeast).  
- **M**: China Taiping and south/southeast office cluster.

![Static map](https://restapi.amap.com/v3/staticmap?location=121.502904%2C31.234844&zoom=16&size=512%2A512&markers=mid%2C%2CA%3A121.502904%2C31.234844%7Cmid%2C%2CL%3A121.5011%2C31.2357%7Cmid%2C%2CJ%3A121.5044%2C31.2363%7Cmid%2C%2CM%3A121.5039%2C31.2338&key=68913ce8db83f7bbe5b4cca9720c7a8f)

#### 4.2 Detour for main customer segments

- **Metro commuters whose offices are in IFC / directly connected towers**
  - Baseline route: Platform → IFC B2 → lifts/escalators to office.
  - Additional walking to buy coffee:
    - If shop is on main flow line, extra **0–40 m** each way.
    - Time: **0–1 minute** detour.
  - Practically **zero perceived detour**: just a quick stop at the counter.

- **Metro commuters heading to towers south/southeast (e.g., Taiping cluster – M)**
  - Baseline: Exits 9A/9B/10 → cross road → head south to offices.
  - Using IFC B2 with coffee shop:
    - Use indoor IFC path slightly east/west then south.
    - Incremental indoor distance vs direct outdoor route: about **50–100 m**.
    - Time: **1–2 minutes** detour.

- **Metro commuters heading to towers west of IFC**
  - Baseline: Exit 8 or 7 then cross to western towers.
  - Through IFC B2, they may:
    - Walk slightly east into IFC, buy coffee, then exit west side mall doors.
    - Incremental distance: **80–150 m**; **2–3 minutes** detour.

- **Office workers already in IFC / adjacent towers**
  - Baseline: office lobby ↔ elevator ↔ B1/B2.
  - Extra walk to shop: often **≤100 m** each way; **3–5 minutes round trip** including queue and pick‑up.
  - Fits micro‑break behavior for coffee.

- **Tourists walking between metro & landmarks (J)**
  - Most pathways either:
    - Pass along IFC’s north side; or
    - Go through IFC to enjoy amenities/AC.
  - Detour into B2 store from these flows: **1–3 minutes**, extra **50–150 m**.

#### 4.3 5‑ and 10‑minute detour ranges & volume

Assuming an average **indoor walking speed ≈ 70–80 m/min** (1.2–1.3 m/s) with escalator waits:

- **5‑minute detour radius** (extra walking allowed for coffee on the way):
  - ≈**350–400 m** of added distance tolerated.
  - Includes:
    - Entire IFC complex and directly connected towers.
    - Offices immediately south (Taiping complex) and west (over Century Avenue) if routed through IFC.
    - Most tourists transitioning between metro and nearby lookout towers using IFC as corridor.
  - Likely pool within 5‑min detour from **existing trip routes**:
    - Core office workers strongly tied to IFC paths: **≥30,000–40,000** people/day.
    - Metro passengers with potential to swing through IFC: **20,000–30,000** more.
    - Mall shoppers already in IFC: **45,000** (not detour, but primary path).
  - Deduplicated, a realistic **effective 5‑minute detour‑eligible** population is roughly **50,000–70,000 unique individuals/day**.

- **10‑minute detour radius** (especially lunch / off‑peak)
  - ≈**700–800 m** of added distance possible for more deliberate visits.
  - This covers:
    - Full 800 m Grade‑A office cluster (estimated **125,000 workers**).
    - Nearby hotels and residential towers within 800–1,000 m.
  - Even if only:
    - **20–25%** of the 125,000 office workers are willing to walk at least once per day/week to IFC coffee, that’s **25,000–31,000** extra potential users.
  - Including tourists & residents, **10‑minute detour‑eligible** pool is plausibly:
    - **70,000–100,000 people/day** with a practical path that could include IFC, depending on weather and time budget.

### 5. Visibility analysis

Since the location is **inside a mall at B2**, visibility is **internal‑corridor**, not streetfront.

- **Macro visibility (district level)**
  - IFC Mall sits at the junction of:
    - 世纪大道 (Century Avenue) and 银城中路 (Yincheng Middle Rd).
    - Adjacent to the Lujiazui central roundabout (high symbolic visibility).
  - For drivers and pedestrians at street level, IFC is a known destination; wayfinding to the mall is trivial.

- **Micro visibility (inside mall / B2)**
  - B2 level in IFC functions as:
    - Metro connection layer.
    - Access to supermarket, casual dining, and several coffee/snack brands.
  - Based on typical design:
    - Main **metro → mall** access corridors and vertical cores channel a large share of traffic.
    - Units close to the main mall–metro funnel (escalator lobbies, B2 atria, supermarket entrances) have **high continuous passing flows**.
  - For LG2‑45, critical questions (to verify on detailed mall plan):
    - Distance to the primary metro connection/escalator: if **≤30–40 m**, visibility is excellent.
    - Whether there is a **straight sightline** from the escalator or main corridor; turns and dead ends sharply reduce casual discovery.

Given the known layout of IFC and the high density of F&B on B2, it is reasonable to infer:

- The store will be in a **traffic‑oriented B2 band**, not a remote service alley.
- Competition (other coffee/tea brands) will likely be **within 10–60 m** sight, which increases local clustering but splits demand.

---

### 6. Summary: Traffic Pros & Cons

**Pros (traffic & accessibility)**

- **Exceptional transit access**
  - Lujiazui Metro Station (Line 2) within **40–100 m** via multiple exits, with **>100,000 daily entries/exits**.
  - At least **10+** bus stops within **400 m**, capturing strong surface transit flows.

- **Strong walk‑in office and mall traffic**
  - ~**125,000** office workers in 800 m; **24,000** directly above/adjacent to the mall.
  - IFC Mall itself averages **~45,000 visitors/day**, with peaks up to **80,000–100,000**.
  - A large share of these visitors naturally pass along B2 where the store is located.

- **Minimal detour cost for key users**
  - For IFC and directly linked towers, extra walk is **≤1 minute**, often essentially zero.
  - For nearby towers using the mall as a corridor, detours are typically **1–3 minutes**, **≤150 m**.
  - Effective 5‑minute detour‑eligible population is roughly **50,000–70,000 people/day**.

- **Abundant parking**
  - At least **10–15 structured parking facilities** within **200 m**, estimated **3,000–5,000 spaces** within **600 m**.
  - Supports car‑borne shoppers and office workers during weekends and off‑peak hours.

- **High‑intensity, all‑day flow**
  - Morning and evening commute peaks driven by metro/office linkage.
  - Lunchtime and early evening peaks from office workers and mall patrons.
  - Weekend and holiday boosts from tourists and families.

**Cons / Risks (traffic perspective)**

- **Internal (not streetfront) visibility**
  - Being at **B2** means no spontaneous street‑level capture; traffic depends entirely on internal mall routing and signage.
  - If LG2‑45 is not directly on the **primary metro–mall funnel**, actual exposure could drop sharply compared with the theoretical catchment.

- **Flow competition**
  - Dense clustering of coffee and beverage brands in **0–250 m**:
    - At least **3 major coffee chains** + multiple tea/dessert competitors.
  - Segments with **≤1–2 minute detour tolerance** may split across the nearest few counters; operational speed and queue management are critical.

- **Directional bias**
  - Flows are **strongly directional by time of day**:
    - AM: dominated by inbound commuters (grab‑and‑go).
    - Lunch: short time windows.
    - PM: outbound; lower appetite for sit‑down.
  - Store concept must match **short‑dwell, speed‑oriented** needs for peak periods.

### Overall traffic potential conclusion

From a **traffic and accessibility** standpoint, this IFC B2 coffee location is in the **top tier of Shanghai CBD sites**:

- Direct plug‑in to **>100k/day** metro flows, **~45k/day** mall visitors, and **~125k** surrounding office workers.
- Additional walk/detour to the store is generally **≤3 minutes** for the majority of high‑value commuters and mall shoppers, with an estimated **50k–70k** people/day in an easy **5‑minute detour** band.

If the unit enjoys **clear visibility from the main B2 corridor/metro connection** and maintains **fast throughput**, the location can realistically sustain the transaction ranges mentioned in the previous customer analysis and provides a robust basis for long‑term coffee demand, albeit with high competitive pressure.
