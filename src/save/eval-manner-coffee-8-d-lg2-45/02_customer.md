## 2. Nearby Population Demographics

WorldPop residential stats around the coordinates (note: these capture **residents only**, not commuters or tourists, which are much larger here).

### 2.1 Population & Age Structure

| Radius from store | Total population (residents) | Age 0–14 | Age 15–59 | Age 60–64 | Age 65+ | Share 15–59 |
|-------------------|------------------------------|----------|-----------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| 300 m             | 4,794                        | 497      | 3,183     | 328       | 786    | 66.4%       |
| 500 m             | 12,432                       | 1,313    | 8,254     | 889       | 2,062  | 66.4%       |
| 1,000 m           | 41,603                       | 4,420    | 27,607    | 3,029     | 6,887  | 66.4%       |

**Implications for coffee shop:**

- Even though Lujiazui is an office district, there are **4.8k–12.4k residents within 300–500 m**, mostly working-age adults, but residential is a **secondary** demand source.
- The **true daily potential** is driven by **office workers + mall shoppers + metro passengers + tourists**, not captured in residential data.

  - Position: **Luxary flagship mall**, 6 levels (B2–L4), directly linked to Metro Line 2.
  - Tenant mix: Global luxury brands + Apple flagship + F&B + cinema.
- Nearby malls (within ~500–700 m, from general knowledge/search, not all in tool list):
  - **Super Brand Mall**, **L+ Mall**, etc. – add to general area traffic but less direct for a B2-located coffee unit.

### 3.4 Transport Hubs & Tourist Attractions

## 4. Shanghai IFC Mall & Lujiazui CBD Traffic

Direct precise daily footfall for Shanghai IFC Mall is not published in the search results, but we can bracket plausibly using:

- GFA 110,000 m², high-end positioning, direct metro integration.
- Comparable Tier-1 luxury malls in CBD China (e.g., Beijing/Shanghai) typically see:
  - **Weekday daily visitors:** ~40,000–80,000
  - **Weekend/holiday daily visitors:** ~80,000–150,000

Given:
- IFC is one of Shanghai’s **top turnover malls** (2024 article: “shopping mall with the highest turnover in Shanghai is … Shanghai IFC Mall (Lujiazui)”.
- Direct access from a **major metro line**.
  
A conservative estimate for **IFC Mall average daily visitors**:

- **Deterministic (conservative):** 45,000 visitors/day
- **Upper potential:** 80,000–100,000 visitors/day on average, with peaks above that on holidays

Lujiazui office and tourist base:

- YicaiGlobal report: **88 buildings**, 55 Grade-A+ near **>90% occupancy** including IFC and Jin Mao.
- Typical large office towers (50–80 floors) in Shanghai house **8,000–15,000 workers**.
- Within **600–800 m**, there are at least:
  - 4–6 mega-towers (Jin Mao, SWFC, Shanghai Tower, IFC towers, etc.) + numerous 30–40F office towers.

Conservative **daytime office worker pool within 800 m**:

- Assume:
  - 8 very large towers × 10,000 workers = 80,000
  - 15 medium towers × 3,000 workers = 45,000  
  → **≈125,000 office workers** in an 800 m radius.

---

## 5. Main Customer Sources

For a coffee shop on **B2 (LG2)** connected to metro & mall circulation:

### 5.1 Office Workers in IFC Towers & Immediate CBD

- **Primary segment:** White-collar workers in IFC & adjacent towers.
- Estimation for **IFC complex itself**:
  - 2 main IFC towers + adjacent office buildings:
  - Assume 3 Grade-A buildings × 8,000 workers = **24,000 workers** in the directly connected IFC/adjacent towers.
- Realistic share who:
  - Come through B1/B2 for **commute/meal/coffee**: perhaps 70–80% on weekdays.
  - Coffee-buying penetration among these commuters:
    - Conservative: 15–20%
- Deterministic office-worker coffee demand from **IFC-connected towers**:
  - 24,000 workers × 70% pass by B2 × 15% buy specialty coffee at least once/day  
    ≈ **2,500–2,700 potential coffee transactions/day** for **all** B1–B2 coffee vendors combined.
- With **4–5 direct coffee competitors**, an even split would suggest **500–700 daily transactions** addressable for this one shop; brand/positioning can adjust that up or down.

### 5.2 Mall Shoppers & Leisure Visitors

- Mall average **45,000 visitors/day (conservative)**.
- Not all reach B2; some stay on upper luxury floors.
- Assume:
  - 60% of mall visitors use levels connected to metro/B2 corridors at some point → 27,000/day crossing or near B2.
  - Of those, 30% are realistically “coffee occasions” (resting, waiting, socializing) → 8,100/day for all B2/B1 coffee & drinks.
- With strong competition (Peet’s, Manner, Starbucks, tea & dessert):
  - If this shop can secure **10–15% share** of these drink occasions:
    - 8,100 × 10–15% ≈ **810–1,215 daily transactions** potential from mall/general visitors.

### 5.3 Metro Passengers (Lujiazui Station – Line 2)

- No exact station data in search, but Line 2 core CBD stations in Shanghai plausibly see **100,000–200,000 entries+exits/day**.  
- Only a fraction will pass through IFC B2:
  - Assume **30%** of total Lujiazui station users pass through IFC concourses (direct exits) → if 120,000/day, then 36,000/day.
  - Coffee purchase penetration for commuting passengers: 5–10%.
  - → 36,000 × 5–10% ≈ **1,800–3,600 coffee/tea/snack purchases/day** across all B2/B1 fast beverage outlets.
- For this unit:
  - With many competing kiosks and chains, capturing 10% of these beverage occasions:
    - 1,800–3,600 × 10% ≈ **180–360 daily transactions** from pure metro-flow commuters.

### 5.4 Tourists & Hotel Guests

- Tourists visiting **Oriental Pearl Tower, Jin Mao, SWFC, Shanghai Tower** often walk through or past IFC, especially for dining and shopping.
- The Ritz-Carlton and nearby 5-star hotels house high-spend guests.
- Estimate:
  - Average daily tourist/visitor numbers using IFC as **a base for meals/shopping**:  
    - Conservative: **8,000–12,000 tourists/day** entering or using IFC / immediate streets (non-office workers).
  - Coffee penetration higher (resting, meeting): assume 20%.
  - → 8,000–12,000 × 20% = **1,600–2,400 beverage occasions/day** across F&B venues.
- This single coffee shop could realistically capture 5–10% if positioned well:
  - → **80–240 daily transactions** from tourist/hotel segments.

### 5.5 Local Residents within 500–1,000 m

- 500 m radius residents: **12,432 people** (8,254 working age).
- Given high property prices and small household sizes, many will still be commuters using Lujiazui daily.
- Conservative local-resident coffee demand:
  - If 15% are regular specialty coffee consumers = 1,866 persons.
  - If each averages 0.7 in-store purchases per week at this specific shop (rotating among many options):
    - Weekly transactions from residents ≈ 1,306 → ≈ **190/day on average**.

---

## 6. Customer Number Estimation

### 6.1 Deterministic (Conservative) Daily Transaction Potential

Sum of segments, assuming **moderately conservative shares** for this one shop:

- Office workers (IFC-connected towers)  
  → **500–700** per day
- Mall visitors (non-office, general shoppers)  
  → **800–1,000** per day
- Metro-only commuters (passing through, not counted above)  
  → **180–300** per day
- Tourists & hotel guests  
  → **80–150** per day
- Local residents / neighborhood usage  
  → **150–200** per day

**Deterministic combined range:**

- **Low case:** 500 + 800 + 180 + 80 + 150 ≈ **1,710 transactions/day**
- **High conservative case:** 700 + 1,000 + 300 + 150 + 200 ≈ **2,350 transactions/day**

Given overlapping segments and double-counting risk (e.g., some office workers are also counted as mall visitors), we should discount by ~20–25%:

- Discounted deterministic range:  
  **≈1,300 – 1,900 transactions/day**

For planning purposes:

- **Deterministic average potential:** **~1,600 transactions/day**  
  (including all drinks + some food/pastry items)

### 6.2 Upper Potential (Optimistic, Strong Execution)

If:

- Store has **strong brand**, good visibility and access on main B2 traffic line.
- Effective promotions with office towers and metro commuters.
- Operationally strong (fast throughput at peak morning & lunch).

Then:

- Market share vs competing coffee/tea outlets in B1/B2 corridors could be higher, say **20–25%** of beverage occasions in its micro-zone rather than 10–15%.
- That would push realistic **upper potential**:

  - **2,200–2,800 transactions/day** (weekday peaks, lower on some weekends).

As a safe **planning upper bound**, after discounting for overlap:

- **Potential maximum sustainable average:** **~2,500 transactions/day**  
  (with peaks likely above 3,000 on Fridays / holidays).

## 7. Main Customer Sources – Summary

**Ranked by contribution:**

1. **Office workers in IFC + surrounding Grade-A towers (within ~300–500 m)**  
   - Size: approx. **50,000–80,000** people within easy walking distance; ~24,000 in directly connected IFC/adjacent towers.
   - Time windows: **weekday mornings (08:00–10:00), lunch (11:30–13:30), afternoon (15:00–17:00)**.

2. **IFC Mall shoppers & leisure visitors**  
   - Mall footfall: **~45,000 visitors/day** conservatively, with higher peaks.
   - Time windows: **afternoons, evenings, weekends, holidays**.

3. **Lujiazui Metro Station passengers** (Line 2)  
   - Station traffic likely **>100,000 entries+exits/day**; substantial fraction uses IFC-linked exits.
   - Time windows: **commute peaks (07:30–09:30, 17:00–19:30)**.

4. **Tourists & hotel guests** (Ritz-Carlton, landmarks)

## 8. Pros & Cons of the Location (Customer Perspective)

### Pros

- **Extremely dense daytime population:**
  - ~125,000 office workers within 800 m.
  - High-occupancy Grade-A towers; office vacancy low ( >90% occupancy among core buildings).
- **High mall and metro footfall:**
  - IFC Mall ~45,000+ daily visitors; direct integration with a major Line 2 station.
- **Multi-segment demand:**
  - Office workers + shoppers + tourists + hotel guests + residents.
  - Reduces reliance on a single segment; supports all-day trade.
- **Premium spending power:**
  - Luxury mall, bank/finance workers, 5-star hotel guests → higher ticket per transaction vs. average CBD.

### Cons

- **Intense competition at very close range:**
  - At least **3 branded coffee chains** within ~250 m inside same complex (Manner, Peet’s, Starbucks).
  - Multiple bakeries, dessert shops, tea and matcha brands targeting similar impulse/coffee occasions.
- **B2-level visibility risk:**
  - Performance heavily depends on **exact corridor location**, signage, and line-of-sight to main metro/mall flows.
  - A unit off the main pedestrian stream can lose a large share of potential.
- **High expectations and rent:**
  - IFC is one of Shanghai’s top-turnover malls; occupancy costs and marketing expectations are high.
  - To be viable, the store must achieve **high daily transaction volume** (likely >800–1,000/day) with good average check.

---

## 9. Overall Assessment

- **Deterministic customer volume potential:**  
  - ~**1,300–1,900 transactions/day** achievable with solid but not exceptional performance.
- **Potential maximum (with strong brand/ops & prime corridor location):**  
  - Up to **~2,500 transactions/day** on average; higher on peak days.

Given the extremely strong office, mall, metro and tourist base around Shanghai IFC and the density of competing coffee concepts already present, this site is **volume-capable but highly competitive**. Success will hinge on:

- Securing a **high-visibility unit on a main B2 path** (between metro exits and office/mall core).
- Differentiating on **speed, quality, or concept** from Starbucks/Peet’s/Manner.
- Targeting **workday peaks** with efficient queuing and pre-order/delivery options.

From a pure **customer potential** standpoint, the location comfortably supports a **high-volume coffee shop**, assuming the above operational and positioning factors are addressed.
