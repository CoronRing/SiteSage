# Weighting Rationale

- **Store type & context**
  - Coffee shop / café located on **LG2 of Shanghai IFC Mall, Tower D**, in a prime CBD (Lujiazui) with dense office and retail activity.
  - Likely customer mix: office workers in the towers, mall staff, shoppers, and some transit-linked visitors.

- **Traffic & Accessibility – 0.40**
  - Basement (LG2) location makes **visibility and internal mall traffic flows** critical.
  - Daily, repeat visits from office workers and mall employees depend heavily on **convenient access from offices, escalators, and transit connections**.
  - Coffee is a **high-frequency, semi-impulse purchase**, so capturing natural foot traffic is more decisive than fine-grained demographic targeting.

- **Customer (Population/Demographics) – 0.30**
  - The mall and office context implies a **relatively defined but broad segment**: white-collar professionals, higher-income shoppers, and international visitors.
  - The offer must align with **price expectations and quality standards** of a premium CBD mall, but it is not a narrow niche concept.
  - Because the environment already filters for a suitable demographic, **precise demographic targeting is less critical** than ensuring strong access and convenience.

- **Competition – 0.30**
  - Shanghai IFC and the surrounding Lujiazui area are **coffee- and beverage-dense**, with both international chains and local specialty brands.
  - Competition matters for **share of wallet and differentiation** (brand, quality, speed, seating, ambiance), but the captive flow of office and mall traffic means that **being well-placed within the traffic stream can offset some competitive pressure**.
  - Thus, competition is important but slightly secondary to traffic/accessibility in determining location success.
