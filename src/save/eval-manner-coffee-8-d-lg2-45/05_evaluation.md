# Evaluation Scores

## Customer Analysis: 8.5/10
The report describes a classic Tier‑1 CBD node with dense Grade‑A offices on top of a high‑performing luxury mall directly linked to a major metro line, implying a very strong repeat base and commuter funnel. Conservatively interpreting the author’s own segment estimates, a single store could draw on several hundred to ~1,000 weekday cups from repeat office and commuting users alone, but corridor‑level repeat passers are more plausibly in the “strong” (18k–45k/day) than “prime” category once B2 micro‑placement and realistic path shares are applied, so Section 1 is scored in the upper part of the strong band (8.6). The morning peak is clearly powerful, with large numbers of office workers and metro users passing through IFC’s lower levels; however, the LG2/B2 position and dependence on being on a main path (explicitly noted as a risk) suggest a strong but not absolute funnel, supporting an 8.4 in Section 2 rather than a prime 9+ score. Leisure and mall/tourist flows are exceptional: the report’s own conservative IFC visitor and tourist estimates imply far above the rubric thresholds for both passers and incremental cups, justifying a very high leisure score (9.5) while recognising this is incremental, not the core driver. Storefront exposure is explicitly flagged as contingent on the exact corridor; assuming a typical LG2 corridor with good but not guaranteed majority flow coverage, it fits the 25–50% exposure band, hence 8.0. On competition, the node’s deterministic coffee demand (combining large office, metro and mall volumes) is far above 3,000 cups/day with only about four major coffee chains on the same main flows, so despite being “highly competitive” in feel, the demand-per-operator looks healthy and merits a high score (9.0) rather than a penalty band. Flow stability is excellent: Lujiazui is a mature, high‑occupancy financial CBD with top‑performing retail and no obvious structural decline risks along these corridors, warranting 9.5. Finally, the demographic and price fit is near-ideal—financial white‑collar workers, luxury shoppers and 5‑star hotel guests, plus an existing dense coffee ecosystem—so Section 7 scores 9.5. Applying the rubric weights and caps yields an overall customer potential score of about 8.5, reflecting a very strong, volume‑capable but not risk‑free location, where actual performance will hinge on precise micro‑placement and execution rather than underlying demand depth.

## Traffic & Accessibility: 7.7/10
The report describes an extremely strong CBD transit and office setting with some uncertainty about exact corridor intensity. For A, the author estimates 10,000–20,000 people per day within 10–20 m of the storefront over the full day and highlights heavy commuter flows; extrapolating to the 07:00–10:00 window, this plausibly supports a solid but not top-tier band, so 6.5 reflects a conservative assumption given lack of explicit morning counts. For B, most key commuters (IFC and directly connected towers, plus many using IFC as a corridor) face 0–3 minutes of extra walk, often on their natural path from metro/parking to office, matching the “excellent on‑path” definition, justifying 9.0. For C, the environment is strongly commuter-dominated: ~125,000 nearby office workers, strong AM/PM peaks, and mall flows layered on top, so a 9.0 aligns with a commuter-heavy base. For D, Lujiazui Station on Line 2 is a very large hub with >100,000 entries/exits and a directly integrated mall connection, but only a single metro line; with a conservative relevant capture of 30,000–60,000 daily passengers through IFC, this fits the upper end of the “moderate” band, hence 6.5. For E, the report cites ~125,000 workers within 800 m plus ~41,600 residents within 1 km, giving a combined base near 160,000 with workers clearly very strong, supporting 8.5 in the dense-urban / near-core range. For F, about 24,000 workers are directly above/adjacent with indoor linkage (IFC and connected towers) plus on-site hotel guests, satisfying the ≥15,000 captive threshold and clear daily-path integration, so 9.5 is appropriate. For G, the unit is on B2 in a traffic-oriented layer linked to metro and supermarket, likely near main spines but with noted uncertainty about exact sightlines and proximity to the primary metro–mall funnel; this supports a “strong but not prime” placement at 7.5. For H, there are an estimated 3,000–5,000 parking spaces within 600 m, with multiple IFC and adjacent-tower garages within ~200 m and easy CBD drop-off, meeting the rubric’s top band for car accessibility, so 9.0 is warranted. Combined, these yield an overall weighted score of 7.7, with no global caps binding because all critical sub-scores exceed their minimum thresholds.

## Competition Analysis: 7.7/10
The report describes an extremely high-volume CBD/mall node with dense office, mall, and metro-linked traffic, and explicitly references prior modeling that supports realistic sustainable volumes of roughly 1,300–1,900 cups/day with upside to 2,200–2,500, clearly placing Effective Node Volume in the ‘Excellent’ band (≥1,000 cups/day), scored here as 9.2. At the same time, the analysis documents around 20+ coffee shops and 10+ bakery/dessert outlets within 250 m, and about 40–45 coffee-centric competitors within 800 m, calling the node “functionally saturated” and noting that a generic entrant risks falling below viability; this aligns with the ‘Poor’ saturation band (high outlet counts, high per-capita density, clear cannibalisation risk), scored 3.8 rather than lower because overall demand is still very strong and there is no explicit evidence of many weak units. On positioning, the report identifies several concrete, monetizable white spaces—hyper-fast commuter coffee, food-plus bundles, health/functional focus, and targeted corridor commuters—while acknowledging that most major format/price tiers are already covered; this supports a ‘Good’ but not ‘Excellent’ white-space score of 7.5, implying meaningful but execution-dependent incremental uplift. Anchor and incumbent risk is clearly high: multiple top-tier brands (Manner, Starbucks, Peet’s, Fuel, etc.) are within 50–100 m on the same general flows, yet there is no single hero/flagship unit co-located at 0–10 m; this matches the ‘Poor’ band where several strong chains closely overlap core use cases but without a single dominant flagship on top of the site, scored as 4.0. Combining these with the rubric’s weights and no applicable caps yields a final weighted score of approximately 7.7, reflecting a very strong volume opportunity tempered by heavy saturation and intense anchor competition.
