# Understanding

The planned store is a **coffee shop** located at **上海自由贸易试验区世纪大道8号上海国金中心D座地下二层LG2-45室**, which corresponds to the **LG2 level of Tower D in Shanghai IFC Mall (上海国金中心商场) on Century Avenue in Lujiazui, Pudong**.

Using the tools, this address geocodes to a point inside the **Shanghai IFC Mall complex** at approximately **31.2348°N, 121.5029°E** in **浦东新区陆家嘴区域**.

- The location is on the **southern side of IFC Mall**, near the intersection of **世纪大道** and **银城中路**.
- Immediately **north** of the point is the **IFC Mall retail podium**, with numerous brand stores and F&B venues.
- To the **west and southwest**, there are multiple high‑rise **financial and insurance office towers**, giving a strong office‑worker customer base within a very short walk.
- To the **east and southeast**, along 银城中路 and 世纪大道, are more commercial office buildings and supporting services, all in easy walking distance.
- To the **northeast**, within a short walking distance, is the **Jin Mao Tower (金茂大厦)** and the broader **Lujiazui landmark cluster**, a major visitor and tourist area.

This is therefore a **core Lujiazui CBD mixed‑use node** with intensive office, retail, and tourist activity, not a residential neighborhood center.
