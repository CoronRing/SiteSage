The planned coffee shop location is at Unit 219, No. 1111 Zhaojiabang Road, Xuhui District, Shanghai. This address geocodes to a point inside or adjacent to the **美罗城** commercial complex at **肇嘉浜路1111号** in central Xuhui.

This area is a dense commercial hub with multiple surrounding malls and office towers, including **美罗城** at the origin itself, **东方商厦** to the west and **汇金百货** to the northeast. Several large roads form an interchange just northwest of the site, with major north–south and east–west arterials providing strong vehicular flow and external visibility. A major metro or transit hub lies a short walk to the west/southwest, with many exits feeding directly into nearby streets and commercial complexes. To the southeast, there is a secondary school (**上海市第四六中学**), and nearby towers and financial institutions such as **中国银行** contribute to a strong office‑worker and commuter presence.

Overall, the address resolves to a high‑density commercial and transport node suitable for a coffee shop aiming to serve office workers, shoppers, students, and commuters.
