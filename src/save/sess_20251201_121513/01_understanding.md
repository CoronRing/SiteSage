The planned boutique coffee shop is positioned near 南京东路300号 in 黄浦区, 上海, a core commercial area along Nanjing East Road. This corridor is a major retail and pedestrian street with intensive daily foot traffic and strong morning and commuter flows, matching the goal of attracting young professionals and students.

Point A on the map sits directly along or just off 南京东路, close to 南京东路地铁站. Immediately to the south is the main commercial street and metro station area, bringing continuous flows of office workers, retail staff, and shoppers. To the east and west within a short walk are large shopping complexes and department stores along the same corridor, contributing to heavy pedestrian activity throughout the day.

To the north, within a short walking distance, there are residential communities and local streets, providing a base of repeat local customers including students and young residents. The surrounding blocks are a dense mixed-use urban core combining offices, retail, and housing, meaning the location can capture both morning commuter traffic and daytime sit-down customers.

In relative terms, the site is:
- Just beside a major metro exit and commercial street to the south (high visibility and accessibility).
- A short walk east and west from multiple shopping plazas and office towers.
- Slightly south of several residential pockets to the north, which feed neighborhood traffic.

Overall, this positioning supports the concept of a cozy boutique coffee shop aimed at young professionals and students, particularly for strong morning and commuter-period business.
