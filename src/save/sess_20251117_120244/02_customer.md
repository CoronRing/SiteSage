# Customer Analysis

## Population Overview
Examining the potential customer base within different radii reveals the following total populations:
- Within a 300m radius: Approximately 9,419 people.
- Within a 500m radius: Approximately 24,773 people.
- Within a 1000m radius: Approximately 88,714 people.
- Within a 1500m radius: Approximately 178,088 people.

This dense population distribution underscores a vibrant urban center typical for a bustling commercial area like Nanjing Road, suggesting a significant customer base potential for the coffee shop.

## Age Demographics
The age demographics across these radii show a diverse age mix:
- Ages 0-14 represent a minority, with an increase from about 648 in the 300m radius to approximately 12,957 in the 1500m radius.
- The core demographic of 15-59, which aligns closely with the target customers (young professionals and students), consistently makes up the majority. It constitutes about 7,671 people within 300m and expands to nearly 119,560 people within 1500m.
- Ages 60-64 and 65+ show a consistent visible presence, but the younger demographic remains dominant.

The strong presence of the target demographic (ages 15-59) is beneficial for a coffee shop targeting young professionals and students, matching the typical consumer profile for such a business setup.

## Customer Potential Assessment
The population density and demographic composition suggest a robust potential customer base. The dense urban setting of Nanjing Road, combined with strong population numbers, especially in proximities under 1500m and particularly within 1000m (<strong>primary trade area</strong>), aligns well with the business model of catering to young professionals and students. Morning traffic would further benefit from the location's strategic placement amidst a significant working-age population who likely desire quick coffee and breakfast solutions.

Additionally, the high concentration of individuals around working age suggests that foot traffic during typical peak hours for coffee shops will be substantial. These insights point towards a strong customer potential with respect to both foot traffic and lifestyle alignment, which are critical for the success of a boutique coffee shop.

## Data Quality & Limitations
- The demographic data is provided by `worldpop` using the `GCJ-02` coordinate reference system, a standard used in China.
- Age groups are aggregated, which helps understand broader trends but may miss nuanced shifts, particularly within smaller bands of young professionals and students.
- No specific information is available about transient populations or tourists, which could fluctuate considerably in a central business region like Nanjing Road.
- The area is an urban and commercial hub, possibly affecting permanent residential population density perceptions versus actual daytime foot traffic. However, this central area clustering also indicates substantial visitor foot traffic not entirely captured by residential population stats.

Overall, while the provided demographic highlights are strong indicators, supplementary local insights and traffic studies are recommended for more granular market behavior understanding.
