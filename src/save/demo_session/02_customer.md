## 1. Store type and likely customer catchment

**Store:** Boutique coffee shop (cozy, quality‑focused, mid‑price)  
**Location:** Nanjing East Road 300, beside East Nanjing Road Metro Station Exit 2, Huangpu District, Shanghai.

Given:
- High morning and all‑day pedestrian flows
- Heavy commuter and tourist traffic
- Dense mix of malls, offices, hotels, and schools

For a boutique coffee shop in this context, realistic walk‑in catchment:

- **Core radius (0–300 m):** 3–5 minute walk – key for daily repeat (office workers, students, metro users).
- **Extended radius (300–600 m):** 5–8 minute walk – still relevant for commuters and workers.
- **Wider context (up to 1,000 m):** shows the density of workplaces, hotels and tourist flows that feed into the core area, even if many won’t walk more than 5–7 minutes in the morning.

Below, I’ll use the population data (500m / 1,000m / 2,000m) to understand the **resident base**, and the POI data + external info for **mobile population (commuters, tourists, students)**, which is far more important for this site.

## 2. Nearby residential population and age structure

WorldPop population estimates around the point (lat 31.23787, lng 121.48409):

### 2.1 Total population within various radii

| Radius | Approx. population | Comment |
|--------|--------------------|---------|
| 500 m  | **~22,065** people | Very dense inner‑city residential & mixed‑use |
| 1,000 m| **~77,369** people | Large residential & mixed‑use core of Huangpu |
| 2,000 m| **~288,909** people | Wider central Shanghai belt incl. People’s Square, Bund fringe, etc. |

For a coffee shop, **the 500–800 m ring** is the most relevant for repeat local, non‑tourist customers (workers & residents). The figures above are **residential population only** and **exclude** most commuters, tourists, hotel guests, and students who are critical for this location.

### 2.2 Age distribution

**Within 500 m (≈22k residents)**  
- 0–14: **~1,350** (≈6.1%)  
- 15–59: **~14,683** (≈66.5%)  
- 60–64: **~1,903** (≈8.6%)  
- 65+: **~3,770** (≈17.1%)

**Within 1,000 m (≈77k residents)**  
- 0–14: **~5,203** (≈6.7%)  
- 15–59: **~52,241** (≈67.5%)  
- 60–64: **~6,711** (≈8.7%)  
- 65+: **~13,776** (≈17.8%)

**Within 2,000 m (≈289k residents)**  
- 0–14: **~22,476** (≈7.8%)  
- 15–59: **~189,448** (≈65.6%)  
- 60–64: **~24,608** (≈8.5%)  
- 65+: **~52,316** (≈18.1%)

### 2.3 Fit with target customers

Target: **young professionals, students, morning commuters**.

- **15–59 age band** (the main working/commuting group):
  - 500 m: ~14,700 people
  - 1,000 m: ~52,000 people
  - 2,000 m: ~189,000 people  
  Even if only **5–10%** of this working‑age residential base become **occasional or regular coffee buyers**, that’s **700–1,500 potential regulars within 500 m**, plus **2,600–5,200 within 1,000 m** – *before* considering commuters who don’t live here.

- **Students:** Several schools and adult education institutions exist within ~200 m; plus numerous universities in the broader 2 km area (e.g., finance/business schools, continuing education). These students won’t appear distinctly in the population stats but are strongly present in the local urban fabric.

- **Older population (60+):** ~25–27% of residents. This segment is less core for specialty coffee but can support quieter daytime trade (tea, light food, desserts).

## 3. Nearby places and inferred customer flows

The POI search within **≈1,000 m** around the site shows a classic **prime CBD‑tourist mixed node**. Below I summarize key categories and estimate their customer potential. All volumes are **informed estimates**, not exact counts.

### 3.1 Metro and transit – commuters (critical)

Immediately adjacent:
- **East Nanjing Road Metro Station (南京东路地铁站)** with many exits within 50–200 m of the site:
  - Exits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and multiple “entrance/exit” POIs.
  - Lines: 2, 10 (both high‑capacity lines feeding from Pudong, Hongqiao, and other CBD areas).

**Estimated passenger volumes (based on published and secondary sources for similar central Shanghai stations):**
- Likely **150,000–250,000 entries + exits per day** for East Nanjing Road Station.
- **Morning 7–10 am:** ~25–35% of daily traffic → **~40,000–80,000 people**.

Realistically, only a **small slice (say 1–3%)** of this morning volume will buy coffee in or around the station:
- Potential **400–2,400 morning coffee buyers per weekday** from pure commuting flow alone, if:
  - The shop is well‑signed from exits;
  - Service speed supports commuters (low friction takeaway).

### 3.2 Shopping malls & pedestrian street – shoppers + office workers

Within ~0–250 m:
- **恒基名人购物中心 (Henderson celebrity shopping center)** – on top of the location.
- **Abun宏伊国际广场**
- **上海新世界大丸百货**
- **百联ZX创趣场**
- **悦荟广场**
- **圣德娜商厦**

These are multi‑story malls / commercial complexes right on Nanjing East Road pedestrian street.

From external travel/shopping guides:
- Nanjing East Road is one of **China’s top shopping pedestrian streets**, 5.5 km long, with **hundreds of shops, malls, department stores** (e.g., Shimao Plaza, Shanghai No. 1 Department Store).
- Visitor volumes are commonly cited in **hundreds of thousands per day on weekends and holidays**.
- For the immediate 300–400 m stretch around the station, a cautious estimate:
  - **Weekday footfall (all day):** 80,000–150,000 pedestrians.
  - **Weekend/holiday:** 150,000–300,000 pedestrians.

Potential conversion:
- The boutique coffee shop is unlikely to capture more than **0.3–1.0%** of total passing leisure shoppers in a day:
  - That still implies **240–1,500 cups/day** from tourist/shopping street flow alone if visibility and branding are good.

In addition:
- Many of these malls have upper‑floor **offices, training schools, clinics, and service companies**: a core pool of **white‑collar workers**, many of them classic **young professional** coffee consumers.

### 3.3 Offices and white‑collar workers

Direct office tower POIs are less explicitly listed in this short snippet, but typical for this corridor:
- Mall complexes like **宏伊国际广场** and **恒基名人购物中心** usually contain **several floors of offices**.
- Within 600–800 m you are between:
  - People’s Square office cluster (west)
  - Bund / Sichuan Middle Road / Henan Middle Road office and financial institutions (east/south)

A conservative estimate for the **office population within a 700–800 m effective reach**, derived from:
- Floor area typical of this CBD
- Mix of Grade A/B towers above/next to malls
- Government & finance institutions near People’s Square and Bund

**Possible office/white‑collar worker base:**
- **60,000–120,000 office workers** within a radius they might walk for lunchtime coffee, and within 300–500 m for morning coffee if arriving via this station.

If **5–10%** are:
- Either **occasional morning coffee users** (once or twice a week)
- Or **regulars** (3–5 times a week)

Then:
- Potential **3,000–12,000 identifiable “coffee‑inclined” white‑collar individuals**.
- Even if only **10–20%** of those eventually become semi‑regular customers for your specific shop (depending on competition, brand, seating comfort, and price), that’s **300–2,400 repeat customers**.

### 3.4 Hotels and tourists

Within **200–300 m**:
- Multiple hotels:  
  - 凌爵酒店(上海外滩南京东路地铁站店)  
  - 上海宝地朴乐里酒店  
  - 汉庭酒店(南京东路、外滩附近多家)  
  - 全季酒店(外滩九江路店、山东中路店)  
  - 上海艾迪逊酒店 (five‑star level)  
  - 如家精选、如家等经济连锁  
  - 白玉兰、兰欧、锦江都城等中高端连锁  

This cluster indicates **several thousand hotel rooms** within easy walking distance.

Rough estimate:
- Within 400–500 m: at least **1,500–3,000 hotel rooms**.
- Average occupancy: 70–80% across the year.
- Guests per room: ~1.3–1.5.

So, **1,500–3,000 occupied rooms × 1.3–1.5 guests** → **≈2,000–4,500 tourists/business travelers in the immediate area per night**.

Coffee relevance:
- Many hotels have breakfast, but:
  - Tourists often head out for coffee & a snack on the street.
  - Business travelers may prefer a **boutique coffee** vs. hotel buffet after the first day.

If **5–10%** of these people buy **at least one coffee** nearby per day:
- **100–450 additional daily potential customers**, skewed more towards **9–11 am and mid‑afternoon** rather than the strict morning‑commute peak.

### 3.5 Schools and students

Within ~200 m:
- 上海财经大学继续教育学院  
- 上海开放大学新世界集团分校  
- 黄浦区启英少儿业余学校  
- 上海市格致初级中学（应昌期围棋校区）

These represent:
- **Secondary school students** (格致初级中学 – academically strong).
- **Adult/continuing education students** (finance & open university programs).
- **Children’s extracurricular programs**.

Conservative estimates (within 500 m):
- 格致初级中学 campus: ~600–800 students.
- Continuing education + open university (part‑time / evening / weekend): maybe **1,000–2,000 enrolled**, but daily on‑site presence far lower (e.g., a few hundred a day).
- Children’s extracurricular: weekend daytime flows, parents waiting nearby.

Coffee relevance:
- **High school students**: more budget‑sensitive; may visit occasionally for low‑ticket items (cold drinks, small snacks) after class.
- **Adult education students & young professionals on courses**: stronger coffee propensity, especially **evenings and weekends**.
- Realistic daily coffee potential from all nearby schools: perhaps **50–150 cups/day** if the shop is well‑positioned and youth‑friendly.

### 3.6 Tourist attractions & cultural sites

Within ~250 m:
- 申活馆, 锦江都城旧址, 上海失恋博物馆, 中国青年新闻记者协会成立会址纪念馆, 豫园/外滩 nearby in the 1–2 km radius, and the entire **Nanjing Road pedestrian street** treated as a tourist attraction.

Tourist coffee demand:
- High during **weekends, holidays, and late mornings–afternoons**.
- Tourists are more price‑tolerant and experience‑driven (unique interior, good photo spots).
- Given the national and international fame of Nanjing East Road, **tourism is a major all‑year driver**.

### 3.7 Residential buildings

The POI list is dominated by commercial and hospitality rather than residential estates, which is typical for Huangpu inner core:
- Inside 500 m there **are residents (≈22k per WorldPop)** but largely in:
  - Older mid‑rise buildings mixed into side streets.
  - Some redeveloped high‑end apartments.

Role for the coffee shop:
- They support **evening and weekend regular trade**, but in this location, they are **secondary** to commuters, office workers, and tourists.

Assumed **residential coffee‑interested group** within 500 m:
- 15–59 residents: ~14,700
- Assume 10–15% are potential coffee buyers → ~1,500–2,200 people.
- If **20–30%** of those become at least casual regulars → ~300–650 residents forming a **stable local base**.

## 4. Synthesis: Who are the main customer segments?

### 4.1 Segment by source and strength

**1) Metro commuters (Lines 2 & 10 via East Nanjing Road Station)**  
- **Size:** 40,000–80,000 morning passengers; but only 1–3% realistically convertible.  
- **Potential:** ~400–2,400 weekday morning customers (upper bound with excellent visibility and fast service).  
- **Profile:** Young/mid‑career professionals, office workers heading to Bund, Lujiazui (via Line 2), People’s Square, Jing’an, etc.  
- **Time window:** 7:00–10:00, plus some 17:00–19:00.

**2) Nearby office workers (in malls/complexes and surrounding CBD)**  
- **Size:** 60,000–120,000 white‑collar workers within ~800 m.  
- **Role:** Largest pool of **repeatable weekday business**, for:
  - Morning coffee on arrival (if arriving via this station or walking past)
  - Mid‑morning and afternoon breaks
  - Quick informal meetings / laptop work.  
- **Realistic reachable regulars:** 300–2,400 individuals over time, accounting for competition.  
- **Time window:** 8:30–10:30, then 11:30–14:00, and 15:00–17:00.

**3) Tourists + hotel guests**  
- **Size near the shop:** 2,000–4,500 hotel guests in walking distance daily, plus substantial day‑trip visitors from elsewhere in the city.  
- **Behavior:** More price‑tolerant, seeking “nice café near Nanjing Road/Bund,” influenced by online reviews and aesthetics.  
- **Time window:** 9:00–12:00 and 14:00–19:00, strong on weekends/holidays.

**4) Students (secondary + continuing education)**  
- **Size daily nearby:** A few hundred on site, larger base over time.  
- **Role:** Helps fill **after‑school and evening** periods; mix of budget‑sensitive teens and coffee‑interested young adults.  
- **Time window:** 15:30–18:00 and evenings/weekends for adult programs.

**5) Local residents (15–59 age band)**  
- **Size (500 m):** ~14,700 working‑age residents.  
- **Role:** Provide **baseline demand** not tied to office or tourist cycles; more likely to use the café:
  - Weekends
  - Evenings
  - As a third place to sit.  
- **Potential regulars:** ~300–650, depending on fit with their income and lifestyle.

### 4.2 Alignment with store positioning

- **Boutique / cozy / quality focus:**  
  - Strong fit with **young professionals**, business travelers, and many tourists who seek something better than chain coffee or convenience store drinks.
  - Can be positioned as a “little oasis off Nanjing Road” and a place to work or rest.

- **Mid‑range price:**  
  - Acceptable for office workers and tourists.
  - For students and some residents, mid‑range is still okay if you offer entry‑level items (basic americano, student discounts, or combos).

- **Primary on‑premise, plus takeaway:**  
  - On‑premise seats will appeal to tourists, office workers on break, and students;  
  - Fast takeaway line or window is **critical to unlock commuter potential**.

---

## 5. Quantitative potential – a realistic band

These are **scenario‑type estimates**, not forecasts; assume:
- You are one of several coffee options nearby, with good but not dominant brand power.
- Operational quality is high (good coffee, good service, reasonable speed).

**Very rough daily potential bands after ramp‑up:**

- **Morning (7–11 am):**
  - From metro commuters: 150–400 cups
  - From nearby offices/residents/hotels: 80–200 cups  
  → **~230–600 cups**

- **Midday & afternoon (11–18 pm):**
  - Office workers: 120–250 cups
  - Tourists/shoppers/hotel guests: 120–300 cups
  - Students/residents: 50–120 cups  
  → **~290–670 cups**

- **Evening (18–22 pm):**
  - Students, tourists, some residents: 50–150 cups  

In a **steady, mature state**, this location can plausibly support a daily volume range in the **~570–1,420 cups/day** band *if*:
- Competition is not overwhelming,
- The shop is easily found from the metro exits and street,
- Service is optimized for peak flows.

Even if you capture **only the lower end (e.g., 300–600 cups/day)**, that is still quite healthy for a **small boutique shop** in Shanghai, provided unit economics are sound.

---

## 6. Data limitations and assumptions

- **Population data (WorldPop):**
  - Measures **residential** population only; does **not** capture massive daytime inflows of commuters, tourists, and students, which are dominant here.
- **Footfall and station usage:**
  - Based on typical volumes for comparable **central Shanghai stations and famous pedestrian streets**; your actual footfall can differ significantly by exit and micro‑location (second floor vs. street‑level, visibility, etc.).
- **Office worker estimates:**
  - Inferred from known nature of Nanjing East Road corridor and presence of malls/complexes; precise headcounts require building‑by‑building tenant surveys or official stats.
- **Hotel & tourist numbers:**
  - Estimated via room counts and occupancy assumptions, informed by typical Shanghai CBD hotel performance, not precise local hotel data.
- **Competition:**
  - Not analyzed in detail here. Actual performance will strongly depend on how many chain and boutique coffee competitors sit within the same 100–200 m.

---

## 7. Summary

- The site is in **one of Shanghai’s highest‑footfall, most commercially dense corridors**, at a **major metro station on Nanjing East Road pedestrian street**.
- **Residential population** is dense (≈22k within 500 m; 77k within 1 km), but the **true customer base is dominated by mobile populations**:
  - Massive **commuter flows** through East Nanjing Road Station.
  - Large **white‑collar office population** in nearby malls and office complexes.
  - **Thousands of hotel guests** and heavy tourist/shopping street traffic daily.
  - Several **schools and adult education institutions** within a 200 m radius.

- Age structure is strongly weighted towards **15–59 working‑age adults**, aligning well with **young professionals and morning commuters**, the core targets.
- For a **boutique, mid‑priced coffee shop**, this location has **very strong customer potential**, especially for:
  - Morning takeaway (commuters and office workers),
  - Daytime sit‑in (tourists, hotel guests, white‑collar),
  - After‑school/after‑work coffee for students and locals.

If executed well, this site can support **high daily cup volumes** and a diversified customer mix, with the **main pillars of demand** being:
1. Metro commuters,
2. Nearby office workers,
3. Tourists and hotel guests along Nanjing East Road.

This is, structurally, a **top‑tier location** for the store concept described, subject to competition and specific shop visibility/access.
