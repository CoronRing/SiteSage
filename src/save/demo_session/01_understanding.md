The requested location is resolved to **恒基名人购物中心 (Henderson Celebrity Shopping Center)** at **南京东路300号, 黄浦区, 上海市**, adjacent to **Nanjing East Road Metro Station** in central Shanghai.

This area is a dense commercial corridor along **Nanjing East Road**, a major pedestrian and shopping street connecting toward **People's Square** to the west and the **Bund** to the east. The surroundings are characterized by multi-story shopping centers, offices, and continuous street-level retail, which typically generate substantial commuter and tourist foot traffic.
