# Weighting Rationale

- **Store Type & Concept**
  - Boutique coffee shop / café with a cozy, relaxed atmosphere
  - Primarily dine-in, some takeaway; mid-range pricing
  - Operates mainly daytime to early evening
  - Targets **young professionals** and **students** who linger (work, study, socialize)

- **Customer (0.33)**
  - Needs sufficient density of young professionals and students within walking/transit distance.
  - Demographics and lifestyle fit (students, remote workers, office workers) drive repeat visits and dwell time.
  - Important but not dominant: if traffic is weak, even a good demographic match won’t sustain the business.

- **Traffic & Accessibility (0.37)**
  - Daily foot traffic from offices, campuses, and nearby residential areas is critical for consistent volume.
  - Primarily dine-in model benefits from easy walkability, visibility, and convenient access during peak dayparts (morning, lunch, afternoon).
  - Customers often choose cafés based on convenience and proximity for work/study sessions, making accessibility slightly more critical than pure demographic targeting.

- **Competition (0.30)**
  - Coffee is a competitive category, but this concept differentiates via ambiance, quality, and a relaxed environment.
  - As a boutique shop, it can coexist with other cafés if it captures a loyal niche of students and young professionals.
  - Competitive presence matters, but is somewhat less decisive than ensuring strong traffic and the right customer base, so it receives the lowest (yet still meaningful) weight.
