# Evaluation Scores

## Customer Analysis: 4.4/10
The report depicts a dense, high‑income residential and institutional neighborhood, but with community‑scale rather than node‑prime traffic when constrained to people passing within ~30–40 m of the storefront. Using the report’s own conservative weekday estimates, deterministic repeat demand sums to roughly 75–110 cups/day (residents 30–35, students/researchers 20–35, bus commuters 15–20, other local workers 10–20), placing criterion 1 in the 60–120 cup band and thus in the 3.0–4.9 range; 4.0 reflects that the flows are steady but not large, and are mostly community/academic rather than CBD office workers. For the fixed 3‑hour morning window (criterion 2), only a fraction of these repeat cups is likely sold (on the order of 20–30 cups), well below the 30‑cup threshold, producing a 0.0–2.9 classification; 2.5 is chosen because nearby bus stops and school/office commuting do create some peak but not a strong commuter funnel. Irregular leisure/tourist volumes are highlighted mainly for weekends and holidays; on a typical weekday, incremental tourist/leisure cups appear <10, so criterion 3 is in the minimal band at 2.0. Storefront exposure (criterion 4) is strong: the shop is street‑front on a well‑known ‘coffee street’ with good walkability and visibility, so it plausibly intercepts a substantial share of local flows without detours, fitting the 7.5–8.9 band; 8.0 reflects that it is on a main pedestrian corridor for this micro‑area. Competition is intense: media describe ‘dozens’ of coffee/tea/bar venues including %Arabica on the same street, and the report itself stresses the risk of high competitive fragmentation; even if node‑wide demand for coffee is healthy, per‑store share is tight, so criterion 5 is set mid‑band at 5.5. Flow stability (criterion 6) is high: anchors are long‑standing (dense residential, major hospital campus, universities, CAS institutes, historic tourism status), with no structural decline indicated, warranting a stable score of 8.0. Demographic and price fit (criterion 7) is very favorable: within 500 m there are ~11,400 people aged 15–59, with 4,000–4,600 identified as core coffee users plus 3,000–4,500 students/科研/医护, in an affluent ‘学区房 + 咖啡文化’ area, so a high but not perfect band score of 8.5 is appropriate. When weighted by the rubric’s percentages, these subscores yield an overall customer‑potential score of 4.4/10; this is further constrained by the weak combined score of criteria 1 and 2, which caps the location well below ‘prime’ despite its strong fit and exposure within a small but competitive community node.

## Traffic & Accessibility: 6.2/10
The report clearly supports a moderate-to-strong traffic and accessibility profile for a commuter-focused specialty coffee shop, but not a top-tier hub. (A) Morning pass-by directly at the storefront is inferred to be meaningful but not at core-CBD or in-station levels: the 500 m radius has 19,563 residents and the street is a well-known café strip and key connector, so several thousand commuters likely pass 07:00–10:00, fitting the 6.0 band (steady but not the heaviest corridor). (B) Path fit is strong for many core users: local residents and bus riders essentially pass by with near-zero detour, while metro users from the two stations incur 3–5 minutes extra if they are not already heading into the neighborhood; this yields a solid but not perfect on-path score of 7.5. (C) The area is clearly commuter-dominant on weekdays, with strong resident, medical, and research populations and explicitly described morning/commute patterns; leisure/tourist flow is mainly weekend/holiday, so peak-hour alignment is excellent, justifying 9.0. (D) Macro transit presence is very strong in absolute terms (two major metro stations and several busy bus stops), but only a fraction of the 250k+ station entries/exits naturally walk toward this specific street, placing the conservative relevant volume in the 30k–79,999/day range and capping the score around 6.0. (E) Within 1 km, 88,024 residents plus substantial institutional employment create a dense urban base well above 90,000, supporting 8.0. (F) However, there is effectively no captive same-building or same-complex workforce; the unit is a street shop, and nearby institutes/hospitals are several hundred meters away, so captive population is <1,000, warranting a very low 1.5 and enforcing the rubric’s overall cap at 7.0. (G) Visibility and placement on the main street spine are excellent: the store fronts a primary pedestrian axis recognized as a “coffee street,” with strong line-of-sight from key intersections, thus scoring 9.0. (H) Car access and parking are weak: the report notes limited structured parking, reliance on scattered street and residential spots, and a known perception of parking difficulty, though basic drop-off is still possible, fitting a poor but not catastrophic 3.5. These component scores produce a weighted overall of 6.2, consistent with a good neighborhood-commuter location that lacks captive towers or direct station integration.

## Competition Analysis: 4.2/10
The report itself estimates a realistic sustainable range for the new store of about 130–260 cups/day if it can secure 5–10% of the node’s overall coffee demand, implying an RSV clearly under 300 cups/day and likely around 200–220. That places the node for this specific store in the ‘failing/marginal’ band on RSV, so Effective Node Volume is scored low at 3.8 despite the broader street’s popularity. Saturation is high: ~18–20 coffee outlets within 500 m and ~35–40 within 800 m serving roughly 10–13k high-potential users, and the author explicitly calls the area ‘structurally saturated’ with only limited incremental room, which supports a ‘poor’ saturation score of 4.0 rather than higher. At the same time, the report clearly identifies a credible but execution-sensitive white space—long-stay, study/office-friendly specialty with strong neighborhood/community orientation—serving an estimated 3,000–4,500 relevant users; this is meaningful but not transformative in volume terms, so Positioning White Space is marked as adequate at 6.2. Anchor risk is significant: a globally recognized %Arabica unit is effectively co-located at ~3 m on the same flow and directly overlaps core use cases, with additional strong chains (Starbucks, Manner, Cotti/库迪) in the near node, justifying a ‘poor’ anchor score of 4.8. Weighted together, and respecting the RSV-based guardrails, these components yield a conservative overall competitive favorability score of 4.2, consistent with a tough but not hopeless node where only a sharply differentiated and well-executed concept can reach the targeted volume range.
