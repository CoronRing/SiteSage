The planned boutique coffee shop is at or very close to **上海市徐汇区建国西路481号**, in a residential block along 建国西路. The static map centers on a spot within **建国西路581弄小区** area in Xuhui District.

This area is primarily **residential**, with multiple neighboring compounds and a fine-grained street grid, suitable for walk‑in customers like **young professionals and students** living nearby or commuting through.

**Surrounding environment (relative orientation):**
- **North:** Dense neighborhood streets and residential buildings along roads such as 建业路、岳阳路, indicating a stable local resident base within a short walk.
- **West (a short walk away):** Cultural and service facilities including venues like an art center and small clinics, bringing some visitor and white‑collar flow.
- **Northwest (very close):** Educational facilities (e.g., a kindergarten) that add regular weekday traffic from parents and staff.
- **South to Southeast (within the same broader block):** Larger institutional complexes including research institutes and hospital‑style buildings, which contribute office workers, researchers, and visitors as potential coffee customers.
- **East / Northeast:** Continuation of mixed residential and institutional buildings, keeping the local catchment dense and walkable.

**Access and flow:**
- The shop location is directly on **建国西路**, a local through street, providing visibility and convenient access for pedestrians, bicycles, and passing cars/taxis.
- The closely spaced intersections and side lanes suggest easy approach from all directions on foot, which fits a cozy, sit‑down coffee shop concept well.
