## Customer Potential Assessment

Given the demographics:
- **Strong Potential within 300-1500 meters**: The age distribution indicates a significant portion of working-age adults, essential for morning and midday businesses like a coffee shop. 
- **Appeal to Commuters and Residents**: The site's location within a busy suburban district, augmented by a significant population density across all distances, suggests high visibility and access to commuters and local residents.
- **Moderate Pricing Tier**: Aligns well with the adult population within this area, which likely includes a mix of middle-income working professionals.

The potential customer base within and beyond a 1500-meter radius is robust, providing a stable foundation for the boutique coffee shop targeted at both local daily business and sporadic visitor traffic from the shopping village.

## Data Quality & Limitations

- **Data Source and Projection**: The data is derived from WorldPop with projections specific to the GCJ-02 coordinate system, which is standard in China.
- **Estimate Validity**: Population numbers are estimates and should be corroborated with in-person surveys or local registers for more precise demographic targeting.
- **Age Buckets**: Limited in elaboration on specific young adult or mid-age brackets which could further refine targeting.
