# Evaluation Scores

## Customer Analysis: 4.0/10
The report clearly shows that the vast majority of reachable customers are irregular airport passengers rather than repeat commuters or office workers. The only true repeat base is airport staff (~1,125 within reach per day, yielding ~300–350 conservative cups/day), which is strong in cup terms but very small in passer volume (<2,000/day), so by the rubric this falls into the lowest band and is scored at 2.5. Morning-peak strength is likewise weak for *repeat* users: staff flows in a 3‑hour window are likely <700 person-times with perhaps ~100 repeat cups, so this is scored at 2.0 despite high total passenger traffic, which the rubric treats as leisure/irregular. In contrast, non-commuter/leisure volume is very strong: about 18,400 passengers/day pass the zone with 276–552 cups/day from them, comfortably fitting the highest cups band but only the 8,000–25,000 passer band, so the score is set at the top of the ‘moderate leisure’ range (7.0). Storefront exposure is inferred to be good but not absolutely dominant: the shop sits in the south-triangle concourse serving roughly 40% of T2 departures, with some uncertainty about exact micro-alignment, so it is scored 8.0 as ‘good exposure’. Competitive conditions are tight but demand is very high; with 600–1,000 cups/day realistic for this unit and multiple competing beverage outlets, node-wide coffee demand likely exceeds 3,000 cups/day and is shared across a limited number of direct competitors, so the competition score is 8.5 in the ‘balanced to favorable’ range. Flow stability is strong for a mature domestic hub airport with integrated rail and metro, though dependent on airline/terminal assignments, so it earns 8.0 as ‘stable’. Demographic and price fit are excellent: almost all reachable users are working-age travelers and staff in a high-income, airport-pricing context with clear coffee culture, so this is scored 9.0. When these sub-scores are combined with the rubric’s weights, the overall result is about 4.0/10; this remains well below the global caps driven by the very weak repeat commuter base and morning funnel, which the rubric prioritizes over large but irregular passenger flows.

## Traffic & Accessibility: 6.2/10
The report describes an airside unit in Hongqiao T2’s south triangle with very strong internal placement but a leisure- and travel-skewed audience rather than classic weekday commuters. For A, morning pass-by, total daily pass-by near the storefront is ~21–22k passengers, but using a conservative 30% allocation to 07:00–10:00 yields roughly 6–7k morning passers, fitting the 5–6 band (scored 5.5). B is excellent (9.0) because south-triangle passengers and nearby staff essentially pass the unit on their natural path or with ≤2–3 minutes detour, and almost no one needs a major backtrack. C is only moderate (5.5) since most volume is air travelers with demand spread across the day; staff commuters exist but are a minority, so the area is not commuter-dominant and morning peaks are limited. D scores 6.0: while the integrated hub (metro lines 2/10/17, HSR, buses) is extremely strong overall, the relevant volume that actually emerges into T2 departures is closer to the 30–79k band rather than being able to fully exploit the hub’s citywide volume. E is weak (3.0) because the 1 km catchment around an airfield has relatively few residents or conventional offices beyond airport functions. F is solid (6.0), reflecting several thousand captive staff on duty daily in the same secure complex and continuously recycling near the unit, though not reaching the ≥7k strong band. G is prime (9.0): the store sits on the main south concourse spine in a dense F&B node with near-universal exposure for south-triangle passengers. H is also excellent (9.0) as Hongqiao offers extensive structured parking and direct drop-off at T2, even though for this specific airside unit parking mainly influences timing rather than increasing the external catchment. These combined factors yield an overall traffic & accessibility score of 6.2, with no global caps triggered.

## Competition Analysis: 7.1/10
The report clearly estimates a realistic sustainable volume of roughly 600–900 cups/day (midpoint ≈750), placing this node firmly in the ‘Strong’ RSV band and justifying a 7.5 for Effective Node Volume in line with the rubric’s 600–799 range. Saturation analysis identifies about 6–7 direct coffee brands plus several fast-food outlets within 300–400 m, serving an effective base of ~20–23k passengers + ~1k staff; this implies around 3–3.5 direct outlets per 10k users—high but still within the rubric’s ‘Adequate’ density band, and the text explicitly notes “dense but not fully saturated,” so a 6.0 is appropriate. On positioning, the report demonstrates that most major slots are already covered (value via Luckin, global via Starbucks, specialty via M Stand/%Arabica, bakery-sitdown via baker & spice), while arguing for only modest but real differentiation in a mid-price, fast, staff-friendly niche; that aligns with a narrow, execution-dependent white space and an ‘Adequate’ 6.0 score. Anchor risk is significant but not extreme: there are multiple top-tier chains (3 Starbucks, 2 Luckins, M Stand, %Arabica, baker & spice) within 250 m, yet no hero/flagship unit co-located and only 1–2 strong chains within ~50 m on the same immediate flows, which matches the rubric’s ‘Good’ band at 7.5. Weighted together, these produce a final competition & node potential score of 7.1, indicating a strong but highly contested node where success depends on superior execution rather than untapped volume or format whitespace.
