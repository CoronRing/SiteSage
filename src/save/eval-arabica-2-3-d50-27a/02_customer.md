## 1. Store & Location Summary  

- **Store type**: Coffee shop  
- **Business mode**: To‑go + dine‑in (within terminal seating only)  
- **Location**:  
  - Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport (SHA) – **Terminal 2**, 3rd floor **departure level**, **airside controlled area**, south triangle, unit D50‑27A  
  - Coordinates: **31.19418, 121.328711**  
- **Effective catchment**:  
  - **Only** passengers and staff **inside T2 departure airside** (post‑security)  
  - Practically no walk‑in from outside the terminal or land‑side business district  

This is a **transport‑hub coffee location**, where local residential demographics are almost irrelevant compared to passenger throughput and staff base.

## 2. Local Demographics (Residential)  

Population here reflects mainly the broader Hongqiao hub / surrounding neighborhoods, **not** the in‑terminal mobile population. Still shown for context.

### 2.1 WorldPop Data Around the Point  

| Radius from location | Total population | Age 0–14 | Age 15–59 | Age 60–64 | Age 65+ | % 0–14 | % 15–59 | % 60–64 | % 65+ |
|----------------------|-----------------|----------|-----------|-----------|---------|--------|---------|---------|-------|
| **500 m**           | 3,761           | 312      | 2,719     | 214       | 425     | 8.3%   | 72.3%   | 5.7%    | 11.3% |
| **1,000 m**         | 12,303          | 1,022    | 8,654     | 647       | 1,248   | 8.3%   | 70.3%   | 5.3%    | 10.1% |
| **3,000 m**         | 126,253         | 11,0﻿00  | 92,204    | 7,536     | 15,903  | 8.7%   | 73.0%   | 6.0%    | 12.6% |

Key implications:  

- Working‑age population (15–59) ≈ **70–73%**, but for this coffee shop, **real customers are almost entirely airport passengers + staff**, not neighborhood residents.  
- These numbers matter indirectly (they drive airport use), but **they are not your direct walk‑in base**.

---

## 3. Airport & Terminal Throughput (Core Data)

### 3.1 Airport Passenger Volume (All terminals)  

From public sources (e.g., English Shanghai government news, Wikipedia, operator info):

- Shanghai Hongqiao Airport recently handles **≈ 48 million passengers/year**.  
- That is **≈ 131,500 passengers/day on average** (= 48,000,000 / 365).

### 3.2 Share of Terminal 2  

Hongqiao layout:

- **T1**: domestic + a small number of regional/intl routes  
- **T2**: **main domestic hub** for China Eastern, Shanghai Airlines, Juneyao Air, others  

By number of based airlines and route structure, T2 is **larger** than T1. A conservative, data‑aligned estimate:

- Assume **T2 handles ≈ 70% of airport passengers**  
  - T2 annual passengers ≈ 48,000,000 × 0.70 = **33.6 million/year**  
  - T2 daily average ≈ **92,000–95,000 passengers/day** (we’ll use **92,000** for conservative calculations)

### 3.3 Departure vs Arrival Split  

- For a primarily domestic hub, daily flow is roughly **50% departures / 50% arrivals**, with some transfer overlap.  
- So:  
  - **T2 departures** ≈ 92,000 × 0.5 = **46,000 departing passengers/day** (all‑day).  

Airside coffee shop mainly sees:

- Departing passengers who have passed security (including transfer passengers), plus  
- A share of terminal staff.

We need to further narrow this to **airside departure hall throughput**.

---

## 4. Effective Airside Passenger Flow Near the Shop

### 4.1 From Total Departures to Departure Hall Footfall  

Not all 46,000 daily departing passengers pass close enough to unit D50‑27A to be realistic customers. Key factors:

- Layout: Unit D50‑27A in **south triangle** – serving a subset of domestic gates (south pier / triangle side).  
- Passengers tend to cluster near **departure security exits, main commercial corridors, and their own gate areas**.  

Assumptions (conservative):

1. **Share of T2 departures using south‑triangle gates**:  
   - Assume **40%** of T2 departing passengers use gates that are reasonably served by the south triangle retail area.  
   - 46,000 × 0.40 = **18,400 passengers/day** whose path likely goes through or close to this area.

2. **Time factor – coffee‑relevant window**:  
   Coffee demand is higher during morning & late‑afternoon peaks, but store will operate across the full departure day (roughly 05:30–22:30 ≈ 17 hours).  
   - Assume passengers are **evenly distributed across the day** for simplicity (this actually underestimates peak‑time opportunity, but keeps average realistic).  

### 4.2 Capture Rate for a Single Coffee Shop  

Airports commonly have:

- Multiple coffee providers (chain cafés, bakery cafés, convenience stores with coffee, etc.).  
- Competing beverage options (tea, bubble tea, juice, fast food).

Empirical benchmarks from other Asian hub airports:

- For a **well‑placed airside café** on a busy concourse, a **1–4% capture** of total passing passengers is a reasonable, non‑aggressive range.
- Higher capture rates (5–8%) typically require: brand dominance + limited competition + seating + prime position immediately post‑security.

Given this is **one coffee shop in a competitive T2 airside**:

- Use **1.5–3.0%** of passing flow in south triangle as realistic capture.

So:  
- Base passenger flow within practical reach: **18,400 passengers/day**  
- **Low‑case capture (1.5%)**:  
  - 18,400 × 0.015 ≈ **276 customer‑transactions/day**  
- **Mid‑case capture (2.5%)**:  
  - 18,400 × 0.025 ≈ **460 customer‑transactions/day**  
- **High but still realistic (3.0%)**:  
  - 18,400 × 0.03 ≈ **552 customer‑transactions/day**

---

## 5. Airport Staff as a Stable Customer Base  

We also need staff numbers inside T2 airside.

Direct numbers are not published, but can be reasonably approximated from airport scale:

- At a 30–35 million passenger terminal, a typical overall staffing ratio (airport + airline + security + handling + retail) is roughly **1 employee per 1,000–1,500 annual passengers**.  
- For **33.6 million passengers/year in T2** and **1:1,200** ratio:  
  - T2 staff ≈ 33,600,000 / 1,200 ≈ **28,000 employees** (including rotating shifts, part‑timers).

Proportion actually spending time in the **airside departure level** (vs landside, offices, maintenance, etc.):

- Assume **40%** of these have airside regular presence (airline gate staff, cabin crew passing through, security, cleaning, retail/F&B employees).  
- Airside‑relevant staff ≈ 28,000 × 0.40 = **11,200 people**.

But only a portion work on a given day:

- If staffing is evenly spread over 2.5× coverage (shifts, days off):  
  - On‑duty on an average day: 11,200 / 2.5 ≈ **4,500 staff** active in/around airside.

Realistic share in the **south triangle zone**:

- Assume **25%** of on‑duty airside staff spend a meaningful part of their day within easy reach of this unit.  
- Staff in local catchment ≈ 4,500 × 0.25 = **≈1,125 staff/day**.

Capture rate:

- Daily coffee purchase propensity near their work station: 20–40% will buy at least one coffee/tea from this particular shop, competing with other vendors and staff cafeterias.  
- Use **25–35%** as a working range.

So:

- **Low staff‑customer case (25%)**:  
  - 1,125 × 0.25 ≈ **281 staff‑transactions/day**  
- **Mid‑case (30%)**:  
  - 1,125 × 0.30 ≈ **338 staff‑transactions/day**  
- **High case (35%)**:  
  - 1,125 × 0.35 ≈ **394 staff‑transactions/day**

Note: Some staff will buy more than one drink/day; above numbers treat “transaction per day” roughly equal to “number of unique staff buyers/day”, so they are conservative for ticket count.

## 6. Nearby Functional Places (Inside Effective Catchment)

Since this is airside, “nearby places” are **airport functions** rather than city buildings. We classify:

### 6.1 Within ~100–200 m (same micro‑zone)

- **Departure gates in south triangle concourse** – multiple domestic boarding gates (exact numbers vary by map source; typically a cluster of >10 gates in that triangle zone).  
- **Security exit corridors** feeding south pier.  
- **Neighboring F&B and retail units**:  
  - Competing coffee/beverage outlets (likely 1–3 units within ~100–200 m).  
  - Convenience stores (FamilyMart/Lawson‑type), bakery, fast food, snack shops.  
- **Gate waiting areas** with seating – typical seat density ~200–400 seats over a few adjacent gates, often over‑capacity at peaks.

### 6.2 Within ~300–600 m (wider T2 airside)

- Other concourse retail rings including:  
  - Multiple restaurants, fast food, beverage brands  
  - Duty‑free (if any regional/intl flights share area), specialty shops  
- Airline lounges (China Eastern lounges, others):  
  - These capture a portion of premium passenger coffee demand.  

### 6.3 Outside (but influencing the flow)

- **Hongqiao Railway Station (high‑speed rail)** and **Metro Lines 2 & 10** are tightly integrated with T2, feeding passenger volume into the same building but up‑stream of security.  
- **Hongqiao Business District** and hotel cluster to the west provide longer‑term demand for the airport but not direct walk‑in for this store.

---

## 7. Main Customer Sources

1. **Domestic departing passengers using south‑triangle / south concourse gates**  
   - Volume: ≈ **18,400 passengers/day** passing in the vicinity  
   - Purchase conversion: **1.5–3.0%**  
   - Result: **276–552 passenger‑transactions/day**  

2. **Airline crew & operational staff transiting through south triangle**  
   - Often purchase drinks before/after flights or between turns.  
   - Likely a subset of the 1,125 staff/day in immediate catchment.

3. **Retail/F&B employees and other terminal staff stationed nearby**  
   - Stable daily base: ≈ **1,125 staff/day** in reach  
   - Captured: **281–394 staff‑transactions/day** (one transaction each, conservative).

4. **Transfer passengers**  
   - Domestic‑domestic connections where passengers remain airside between flights.  
   - Part of the 18,400 figure, but typically with **longer dwell times**, potentially higher coffee spend (possibly 1.5–2 transactions per transfer passenger during long layovers, but we retain conservative 1:1 for counting).

5. **Occasional irregular flows**  
   - Flight delays / cancellations or weather disruptions may **temporarily increase dwell time and consumption** in the area.  
   - Not included in base calculations (they create upside variability).

## 8. Customer Number Estimation

### 8.1 Deterministic (Conservative Working Scenario)

Use **low passenger capture** + **low‑mid staff capture**:

- Passenger‑driven transactions:  
  - 18,400 daily flow × 1.5% capture ≈ **276/day**
- Staff‑driven transactions:  
  - 1,125 staff in local zone × 30% capture ≈ **338/day**

**Deterministic estimated customer‑transactions/day**:  
- 276 (passengers) + 338 (staff) ≈ **614 transactions/day**

This can be viewed as a **reasonable planning baseline** for capacity and staffing.

### 8.2 Potential (Upper but Still Plausible Scenario)

Use **higher but reasonable capture assumptions** & some repeat purchases:

- Passenger‑driven:  
  - 18,400 × 3.0% ≈ **552/day**
- Staff‑driven (including some multiple purchases/day):  
  - Take high case 35% and 10% of staff making 2 purchases/day  
  - Base unique buyers: 1,125 × 0.35 ≈ 394 people  
  - Extra repeat purchases: 394 × 0.10 ≈ 39  
  - Staff‑transactions ≈ 394 + 39 ≈ **433/day**

**Potential higher‑end customer‑transactions/day**:  
- 552 (passengers) + 433 (staff) ≈ **985 transactions/day**

To avoid over‑statement, state a **practical daily potential band**:

- **Conservative deterministic**: **≈ 600 transactions/day**  
- **Likely operational range** (most days): **600–900 transactions/day**  
- **Upper potential on strong days (holidays/peaks)**: up to **≈ 1,000 transactions/day**

On an annual basis (assuming 365 days, minimal seasonality adjustment):

- Deterministic: 614 × 365 ≈ **224,000 transactions/year**  
- Potential upper: 985 × 365 ≈ **360,000 transactions/year**

## 9. Pros & Cons of the Location (Customer Perspective)

### 9.1 Pros

- **High guaranteed footfall**  
  - T2 daily departures ≈ 46,000; around **18,400** likely pass near this zone – a solid base independent of neighborhood economy.
- **Strong captive audience with dwell time**  
  - Domestic departures often arrive 60–90 min pre‑flight; weather or ATC delays can extend dwell time significantly, raising coffee demand.
- **Stable recurring staff base**  
  - ≈ **1,000+ staff/day** in practical reach, generating repeat daily revenue and smoothing weekday vs weekend variation.
- **Price elasticity**  
  - Airport environment supports **higher unit prices** than street‑side cafes, increasing revenue per transaction even at modest capture.
- **All‑year operation**  
  - No “off season” like tourism zones; demand is tied to national mobility patterns and business travel, typically robust in Shanghai.

### 9.2 Cons / Risks

- **Strong competition inside T2 airside**  
  - Multiple coffee, tea, bakery, and convenience chains dilute capture rate. Reaching >3% share of passing passengers may be challenging.
- **Layout dependence**  
  - If unit D50‑27A is **not directly on the main passenger flow line** from security to gates, effective flow (18,400) could be lower; e.g., 25% instead of 40% of departures using that corridor would halve passenger opportunity.
- **Regulatory & security constraints**  
  - Restricted logistics, staff access, and operating hours may limit promotional activities or extended late‑night operation.
- **Traffic volatility by time of day**  
  - Peaks can be dense (queue/capacity constraints), while late hours may be slow; labor scheduling must be precise to maintain profitability.
- **Dependence on airport traffic**  
  - Any future policy change, route shift, or terminal restructuring affecting T2 flow (e.g., moving some airlines to T1 or another terminal) would directly impact demand.

---

## 10. Overall Assessment (Customer Potential)

- **Core demand drivers** are **T2 domestic departures** (~46,000/day) and a sizable **airside staff community** (~4,500 on‑duty daily, ~1,125 in local catchment).  
- Within the **south triangle zone**, your coffee shop can realistically reach:  
  - **Deterministic baseline** ≈ **600 transactions/day**  
  - **Likely operating band** ≈ **600–900/day**  
  - **Potential peak capability** up to ≈ **1,000/day** on high‑traffic or disruption days.  

Given the constrained but dense airside environment and the positioning within the south triangle, this unit has **strong quantitative customer potential**; success will mainly depend on execution (speed, visibility, and differentiation against other beverage options) rather than raw customer availability.
