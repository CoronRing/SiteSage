# Understanding

The planned coffee shop is located inside **Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport Terminal 2** (上海虹桥国际机场2号航站楼), at the **3rd floor departure level within the control area, south triangle, unit D50-27A**. The geocoded point (A) corresponds to the main building of Terminal 2 at **申达一路1号, 闵行区, 上海**.

Spatially, the point sits within the Hongqiao transportation hub area. Surrounding the terminal within walking distance are other terminal facilities, airport-connected commercial areas, and transport infrastructure. The wider Hongqiao business district lies to the west, with major roads and the integrated rail/metro network feeding passenger flow into the airport.

The shop itself will be in the secure departure zone on an upper floor, so the effective catchment is primarily outbound passengers and airport personnel rather than the general public outside the terminal.
