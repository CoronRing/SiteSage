## 1. Public transit availability

### 1.1 Integrated Hongqiao hub access

Your store (A) is in T2 departure level, south triangle, at:

- Lat/Lng: 31.19418, 121.328711  
- Address: 上海市闵行区申达一路1号（上海虹桥国际机场 T2 航站楼出发层管制区内）

The Hongqiao hub concentrates air, high‑speed rail, metro, and coach/bus in one node. External access is effectively “shared” for all T2 airside tenants.

Key rail/metro/bus elements within ~600 m of the store:

- Metro & rail access points (sample, distance from A):
  - “虹桥2号航站楼 地铁站出口” cluster: 9+ entries, 211–556 m from A
  - “虹桥2号航站楼 地铁站” (full station, serving Lines 2, 10, 17): ~406 m
  - Hongqiao Railway Station access (via hub corridors/bridges): ~600–800 m walking to T2 central hall, then to south triangle

- Bus / coach stations (sample, distance from A):
  - “虹桥机场T2航站楼(公交站)” and variants: 159–209 m
  - “虹桥枢纽东交通中心(公交站)”: ~209–248 m
  - Multiple “2号航站楼(公交站/下客站)” stops: ≈180–220 m

- Hub internal access:
  - “虹桥综合交通枢纽(安检区域出口)”: ~112 m
  - Multiple “候车室 / 枢纽” facilities: 112–289 m

In practice:

- Metro passengers: typically 5–8 min from platform to T2 departures level near your zone (≈400–600 m plus escalators/security).
- High‑speed rail passengers: ≈8–12 min walk from Hongqiao Railway Station concourse via enclosed passages and bridges.
- Bus/coach passengers: ≈3–8 min walk via hub transport center into T2.

### 1.2 Static map (hub layout & main access routes)

```markdown
![Hongqiao Hub Access Map](https://restapi.amap.com/v3/staticmap?location=121.328711%2C31.19418&zoom=15&size=512%2A512&markers=mid%2C%2CA%3A121.328711%2C31.19418%7Cmid%2C%2CH%3A121.3212%2C31.1973%7Cmid%2C%2CR%3A121.3272%2C31.2007%7Cmid%2C%2CM%3A121.3312%2C31.1903&key=68913ce8db83f7bbe5b4cca9720c7a8f)
```

- A = Your store location (T2 departure south triangle, airside)  
- H = Hongqiao Railway Station  
- M = Metro “虹桥2号航站楼” station area (Lines 2/10/17)  
- R = Hongqiao long‑distance bus/coach area

**Passenger routes (all weather‑protected once inside the hub):**

1. From H (railway station) to A
   - Walk east via enclosed bridge signed “Terminal 2 / 出发”.
   - Enter central T2 departures hall.
   - Walk east then slightly south into the south‑fork triangle concourse → A.
   - Estimated time: 8–12 min, ≈600–900 m total walking.

2. From M (metro T2) to A
   - From platform → concourse → signed exits to “2号航站楼”.
   - Underground passage heading northwest into T2 lower level.
   - Escalator/lift to departures (3F), south side.
   - Short walk northwest / west along south concourse → A.
   - Estimated time: 5–8 min, ≈350–600 m walking + vertical circulation.

3. From R (coach/bus) to A
   - Follow signs “航站楼2” through hub corridors/overbridges to T2.
   - Enter lower T2, go up to departures level.
   - Walk east then slightly south‑east into south triangle → A.
   - Estimated time: 6–9 min, ≈400–700 m walking.

For your cafe, the **public transit “accessibility” is essentially maximum**: everyone entering T2 via rail/metro/bus must pass through the same few vertical and horizontal funnels before security and then disperse into north/south concourses.

---

## 2. Parking availability

Within 1.5 km of A, Hongqiao has extensive parking integrated into the hub. While exact car parks are not separately listed in the nearby search output, T2 is served by:

- At least 2 multi‑level car parks connected to T2 by bridges and walkways.
- Short‑term drop‑off lanes directly on the departures level.

However:

- **Your effective catchment is airside**:
  - Only passengers who have parked, checked‑in, and passed security can reach you.
  - Car access affects when passengers arrive and how much pre‑flight time they have, but not your *external* walk‑in volume.

Operationally, parking capacity mainly supports:

- Early‑arrival passengers with ≥45–90 min spare before boarding (higher propensity to buy coffee and sit).
- Airport staff who may park or be dropped in staff areas and then walk through T2.

---

## 3. Customer flow analysis

### 3.1 Core customer segments (from previous customer analysis)

- T2 departures: ≈46,000 passengers/day  
  - South‑triangle share ≈40% → ≈18,400 pax/day walking in/near your zone.
- Staff:
  - ≈28,000 staff T2‑wide, ≈11,200 airside related.
  - ≈4,500 on duty daily.
  - ≈1,125 estimated working in or regularly passing through your south‑triangle zone.

Captured transactions (previous analysis):

- Passengers: 1.5–3.0% of 18,400 → ≈276–552 transactions/day.
- Staff: 25–35% of 1,125 → ≈281–394 transactions/day.
- Total working baseline: ≈600–900 transactions/day, with ≈1,000/day possible on peaks.

### 3.2 Typical flow paths and timing

**Departing air travelers:**

1. Arrival to hub  
   - Modal split (rough, typical of major Chinese airports):
     - Metro/rail/bus: ~50–60%  
     - Private car/taxi/ride‑hailing: ~40–50%
   - All converge on:
     - T2 curbside (cars/taxis) or
     - T2 lower concourses via metro/rail/bus passages.

2. Landside → airside sequence
   - Check‑in / bag drop or straight to security (if online check‑in).
   - Security checkpoint to airside concourse.
   - Then diverge toward:
     - North or south concourse, depending on gate.
     - Retail/F&B nodes adjacent to main walking paths.

3. South‑triangle passengers (your main flow):
   - After security, they look at boarding pass → follow overhead gate signage.
   - For south‑triangle gates, standard path leads **directly past or near your unit**.
   - Dwell pockets: waiting seating clusters near gates, F&B zones on the way.

**Airport staff:**

- Security‑cleared daily commuters (airlines, ground handling, security, cleaners, duty‑free, etc.).
- Typical patterns:
  - Start & end of shift: pass near food/coffee units entering/exiting secure area.
  - Breaks: targeted trip from staff areas to known F&B spots.
- For a coffee shop:
  - Morning peaks: staff reporting between ~06:00–09:00.
  - Afternoon/evening: coffee re‑fuel and take‑out at mid‑shift breaks.

### 3.3 Flow concentration near your unit

Based on the map and known T2 layout:

- Your store is on the **south fork** of the main departure spine:
  - Every passenger assigned to south‑triangle gates is a **direct passer‑by** or within ≈50–80 m.
  - Additional spillover from:
    - Passengers from central area exploring F&B options.
    - Misaligned gate assignments causing some cross‑flows.

Assuming:

- 18,400 pax/day are “your” south‑triangle passengers.
- A further 10–15% of other T2 departures may walk through south concourse (incorrect gates at first, walking to shops, etc.), adding ≈2,700–4,000 extra passer‑by exposures.

Total daily **pass‑by headcount near your storefront** is therefore plausibly:

- ≈21,000–22,000 people/day (passengers), plus hundreds of staff passes.

---

## 4. Detour estimation

Here “detour” is extra walking time/distance vs. a direct path from:

- Security exit → gate
- Or rail/metro → security → gate

### 4.1 Geometric position vs. passenger routes

Inside the departure area:

- The south‑triangle gates form a **fan** around the inner triangle corridor.
- A typical passenger path:
  - Security → down a main spine → branch to specific pier.
- Your unit appears placed **on or adjacent to this spine** in the south fork.

Implications:

- For many south‑triangle gates, **passing directly in front of the cafe requires ≤1 minute of extra walking**, and often **zero detour** (it is on-path).
- For north‑pier gates, detouring to your store means:
  - Walk south from central concourse (~150–250 m), then back north: total extra 300–500 m.

### 4.2 5‑min and 10‑min detour ranges

Assume indoor walking speed in an airport:  

- ≈75 m/min (including looking at signs, dragging luggage).  
- 5‑min extra detour ≈ 375 m one‑way or ≈190 m out‑and‑back added.  
- 10‑min extra detour ≈ 750 m one‑way or ≈375 m out‑and‑back added.

Given T2’s footprint:

- Distance from central security exit to your store:
  - Likely ≈150–250 m → 2–4 min.

**5‑min *out‑and‑back* detour range (≈190 m extra path):**

- Includes:
  - Almost all south‑triangle gates.
  - A segment of central gates.
- Customers in this band:
  - Nearly **all the ≈18,400 south‑triangle daily passengers** have <5‑min incremental cost to visit your store compared to going straight to gate.
  - A subset of central‑pier passengers, perhaps another ≈3,000–5,000/day, can drop by with ≤5‑min extra walking.

Conservative estimate in 5‑min detour radius:

- **Passengers:** ≈20,000–23,000/day “could” feasibly visit with ≤5‑min detour.
- **Staff:** Most of the ≈1,125 local‑zone staff are within 2–4 min walk.

Your actual capture (600–900 transactions/day) is ≈2.6–4.5% of this 5‑min‑feasible pool.

**10‑min *out‑and‑back* detour range (≈375 m extra path):**

- Encompasses:
  - Nearly the entire departure level of T2, including opposite (north) concourse.
- Thus:
  - Effectively **all ≈46,000 T2 daily departing passengers** could reach your store with ≤10‑min extra walking time.
  - The entire airside staff base (≈11,200 relevant; ≈4,500 on duty/day) is within this range.

However, long detours are behaviorally rare; most passengers won’t add 10 min unless:

- They have long layovers / flight delays.
- You are a specific destination brand or there is a promotion.

### 4.3 From pre‑security access points

Extra time from major access points to *pass your cafe after security*:

1. Metro station (M) → security → south triangle:
   - Metro → T2 check‑in: 5–8 min.
   - Check‑in/security: variable (10–30+ min; not in your control).
   - Security exit → your unit: 2–4 min (≤250 m).
   - **Incremental detour vs. “straight to gate”:** typically ≤2–3 extra minutes for south‑triangle passengers.

2. Railway station (H) → security → south triangle:
   - H → T2 check‑in: 8–12 min.
   - Security: as above.
   - Security → A: same as above.
   - Again, for south‑triangle gates, detour ≤2–3 min.

Conclusion: **core target customers (south‑triangle departures & nearby staff) face effectively no meaningful detour**, while all other T2 passengers are within reasonable reach if they choose to walk.

## 5. Visibility analysis

### 5.1 Macro‑visibility

- The store is **inside the secure departure zone**:
  - No visibility from outside T2, from the curb, parking, or metro/rail concourses.
  - Marketing to non‑ticketed public is irrelevant; focus must be on **airside signage, gate‑side visibility, and digital/airport media**.

### 5.2 In‑terminal line‑of‑sight

From nearby POI distribution:

- Multiple F&B units cluster within 50–200 m:
  - DQ (11 m from A)
  - baker & spice (47 m)
  - %Arabica (171 m)
  - M Stand (≈132 m)
  - 瑞幸咖啡 (Lucky Coffee, 144 m)
  - KOI Thé and several others within 150–200 m.

This indicates:

- You are located in a **dense F&B node** rather than in a quiet, hidden corner.
- Passengers walking toward south‑triangle gates will see an F&B “strip” with several options.

Visibility drivers:

- **Pros:**
  - High “visual competition” area means passengers are primed for F&B decisions (coffee, snacks).
  - Location is adjacent to main pedestrian stream to south gates (effectively on a major internal “intersection”).
- **Cons:**
  - Multiple adjacent coffee/tea brands significantly dilute spontaneous traffic share.
  - Differentiation (design, frontage width, lighting, merchandising) will heavily influence actual capture.

Given south‑triangle volume (~18,400 pax/day), a unit with **8–12 m wide frontage** facing the main corridor can easily be seen by most passers‑by at least once on the way to gate. If your unit is slightly recessed or side‑facing, visibility drops, but still within 10–20 m line‑of‑sight for the majority of flows.

## 6. Summary: traffic & accessibility assessment

### 6.1 Public transit & access

- T2 is directly integrated with:
  - Metro lines 2, 10, 17 via “虹桥2号航站楼” station (≈400–550 m connections).
  - Hongqiao Railway Station (≈600–900 m walk to T2).
  - Multiple bus and long‑distance coach terminals (≈200–700 m).
- Once inside the hub, all paths converge into a few **security checkpoints** and then split into north/south airside concourses. Your unit is well‑positioned on the south branch.

### 6.2 Traffic potential, by numbers

- T2 daily departing passengers: **≈46,000**
- South‑triangle relevant passengers: **≈18,400/day**
- Airside‑relevant staff: **≈4,500 on duty/day**, ≈1,125 concentrated in your zone.
- People within 5‑min feasible detour of your store:
  - ≈20,000–23,000 passengers/day + ≈1,000+ local staff.
- People within 10‑min feasible detour:
  - Almost all T2 passengers (≈46,000/day) and airside staff (≈4,500/day).

Expected transactions (from prior analysis):

- Baseline band: **≈600–900 transactions/day**; ≈224k–330k/year.
- Peak potential (holiday peaks/irregular operations): **up to ≈1,000/day** (≈360k/year).

### 6.3 Pros (traffic & accessibility)

- **Near‑maximum hub accessibility:** seamless rail/metro/bus access; once people are in T2, they naturally pass through your general area.
- **Minimal detour for core users:**
  - South‑triangle passengers and local staff add ≈0–3 minutes vs. a direct path to gate.
- **High, predictable footfall:**
  - ≈18,400 direct‑zone passengers/day plus constant staff flows, largely independent of weather or local neighborhood factors.
- **Concentrated F&B cluster:**
  - F&B “street” effect ensures high awareness and in‑the‑moment purchase decisions.

### 6.4 Cons / Traffic‑related risks

- **Strong competition literally next door:**
  - At least 3–4 established coffee/tea brands and several F&B units within 50–200 m; capturing even 2–4% of passers‑by requires strong positioning.
- **Dependence on gate allocation patterns:**
  - If airlines/gates are re‑assigned away from the south triangle (e.g., more use of north pier), your effective passer‑by base could drop materially.
- **Limited external catchment:**
  - No access from landside public, no draw from the surrounding 3 km residential or business districts without a boarding pass.
- **Visibility bounded by terminal design:**
  - All visibility is internal to the T2 airside; you rely entirely on airport wayfinding, concession maps, and your storefront design.

---

### Overall traffic conclusion

From a traffic perspective, this is **a high‑volume, structurally strong location** within its constrained universe (T2 departure airside). Your effective market is not the city but **≈18k south‑triangle passengers + ≈1k staff in easy reach per day**, almost all with negligible detour cost to visit your cafe. The main challenge will not be generating footfall, but **winning share** against the dense, high‑quality competing F&B options immediately surrounding you.
