## 2. Demographics within Multiple Radii

Source: WorldPop raster data around 31.220675, 121.379449 (GCJ‑02).

### Population & Age Structure

| Radius | Total Population | 0–14 yrs | 15–59 yrs | 60–64 yrs | 65+ yrs |
|--------|------------------|----------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| 300 m  | 4,887            | 438 (8.96%) | 2,854 (58.4%) | 334 (6.8%) | 697 (14.3%) |
| 500 m  | 14,430           | 1,255 (8.7%) | 8,756 (60.7%) | 1,192 (8.3%) | 2,583 (17.9%) |
| 1,000 m| 64,316           | 5,732 (8.9%) | 39,243 (61.0%) | 5,731 (8.9%) | 12,646 (19.7%) |

**Interpretation for coffee demand:**

- Within **500 m**: ~14.4k residents; about **8,756 working‑age (15–59)**, many likely white‑collar (given eco‑business zone and metro connectivity).
- Within **1 km**: ~64.3k residents; **~39k working‑age**, plus large elderly segment (~12.6k 65+) who contribute daytime park traffic and leisure visits.

This is only **residential population**; the eco‑business cluster adds a significant **daytime working population** on top of this.

---

## 3. Nearby Places & Catchment Structure (≤ 1,000 m)

### 3.1 Cultural, Park & Tourist Resources

- **Industrial Civilization Exhibition Hall (苏州河工业文明展示馆)** – same building
  - Distance: 0–2 m
  - Type: Museum / exhibition
  - Function: Main vertical feeder for the coffee shop

- **Suzhou River “十八湾” (苏州河十八湾)** – 47 m
- **Longfeng Eco‑Business Area 4# Riverside Greenbelt (长风生态商务区4号滨河绿地)** – 157 m
- **“斑马绿地” park** – 287 m
- **云岭公园** – 322 m
- **中铁十八局集团长风公共绿地** – ~630 m
- **银杏广场, 闻天下广场, 半马苏河公园, 洛克公园等** – 600–900 m belt
- Whole area functions as a **continuous riverfront recreation corridor**, drawing walkers, joggers, families, photography and culture tourists.

### 3.2 Offices & Eco‑Business Zone

From Baidu Baike – 长风生态商务区:

- By end of 2012:
  - Built **108万 m²** of office/commercial buildings
  - Cumulative **>400 enterprises** settled
  - 2012 tax revenue 20.73 billion RMB

Assuming:
- Average office density ~10–12 m²/seat → **~90,000–108,000 office seats** in the full eco‑business area.
- Your location lies **inside** this zone, but not all buildings are within 1 km.  
  Conservative assumption: **40–50%** of the district’s office stock within 1 km walk:
  - Seats within 1 km: ≈ 36,000–50,000 office workers.
  - Use **40,000** as a working daytime office population estimate in the 1 km catchment.

### 3.3 Residential Neighborhoods

Specific nearby estates (from housing portals & local info; within ~1 km, mostly north of Guangfu West Rd and along Guangfu West / Changning corridors):

- 南林家港小区 – Guangfu West Rd 7–22 (approx 800–1,000 residents; 8 buildings)
- 隆德小区 – Guangfu West Rd 1145弄*1–19 (multi‑building, density similar to old high‑rise); estimate 1,500–2,000 residents
- Additional unnamed estates on Guangfu West, 云岭路, 丹巴路, and around 北新泾 station.

Cross‑checking with WorldPop:
- **Within 500 m**: 14,430 people
- **Within 1,000 m**: 64,316 people  
→ These numbers already consolidate all residential estates; we’ll use them directly.

### 3.4 Transport & Metro

- **Metro 北新泾站 (Beixinjing)** – ~700 m (Line 2 east‑west trunk; Line 15 north‑south)
  - Multiple exits within 580–810 m
  - Line 2 typical Shanghai station daily ridership: often **40,000–80,000 trips/day** at busy segment stations.
  - Since Beixinjing is not a core CBD station, use **30,000–40,000 entries + exits/day** (conservative).
  - Walking distance to site (8–10 mins) means only a **small fraction** will detour to the riverside.

- Major roads:
  - Guangfu West Rd, 丹巴路, 中环高架 nearby → supports taxi/ride‑hailing and private car access to the eco‑business area.

### 3.5 Retail / Shopping & Competing Destinations

Major malls and retail within 1 km:

- **申亚·悦庭18广场** – 542 m (general mall)
- **兆城·翰邦汇** – 702 m
- **复邦汇商场(翰邦中环广场店)** – 734 m
- **宜家荟聚广场(天山西路)** – 723 m (large retail destination)
- **PARK11（沁和坊‑PARK11）** – 848 m
- **衡宸商业广场, 绚谷广场西座, 世纪生活超市** – 700–980 m range

These provide:
- Additional dining & café options → competition for coffee demand
- But they also **increase total visitor and worker flow** in the zone.

### 3.6 Education & Schools (students, parents)

Within ~1 km:

- 新实验幼儿园 – 264 m
- Several kindergartens (长宁澜狮托育园, 上海市长宁区南新幼儿园, 绿洲幼儿园(长风园)) – 260–900 m
- 小学与中学：
  - 上海延安实验初级中学 – 740 m
  - 上海科技金融博物馆附近的华东师范大学第4附属中学、华东师范大学附属天山学校等 – 770–990 m
  - 北新泾第二小学、其他小学 – ~950–1,000 m

Impact:
- Students: limited direct coffee consumption but strong **afterschool snack / drink** and **parent waiting** demand.
- Teachers & staff: white‑collar coffee demand.

## 4. Footfall / Traffic of the Exhibition Hall & Park Complex

There is no direct published daily visitor count for:

- Industrial Civilization Exhibition Hall (苏州河工业文明展示馆)  
- Specific “Green Land No. 5” preserved building

So we estimate by analogy:

1. **Riverfront park & greenbelt use**
   - Suzhou Riverfront parks like 风铃绿地, 九子公园, 蝴蝶湾, etc. (official Jing’an article) serve local neighborhoods.
   - Typical **urban neighborhood riverfront park**:
     - Weekday average: 1,500–3,000 visitors/day per park segment of this size
     - Weekend average: 3,000–6,000/day
   - Considering multiple contiguous greenbelts in Changfeng Eco‑Business Area, and this is **one preserved landmark building** in that system, estimate:
     - Local immediate park corridor (within 300–400 m of site): **2,000–3,000 unique visitors/day** on a typical weekday in good weather, including:
       - Nearby office workers (walking for lunch/coffee)
       - Residents & joggers
       - Tourists / photographers / cultural visitors

2. **Exhibition building visitors**
   - Mid‑scale municipal museums in non‑CBD locations in Shanghai often attract:
     - Weekday: 300–800 visitors
     - Weekend: 800–1,500 visitors
   - Using conservative mid‑point:
     - Average across week: **~700–800 visitors/day** to this exhibition hall.
   - As your coffee shop is **inside the exhibition building on L3**, its **primary deterministic foot traffic** is a fraction of these visitors.

---

## 5. Main Customer Sources

### 5.1 Deterministic Core (High‑Certainty)

1. **Exhibition Visitors**
   - Average: ~750 visitors/day to the exhibition building
   - Coffee penetration (those who purchase at least one drink/dessert):
     - Assume **15–25%** conversion (indoor café, upper floor, not every visitor buys)
     - Use **20%** midpoint
   - Daily coffee customers from exhibition visitors:
     - 750 × 20% ≈ **150 customers/day**

2. **Park & Riverfront Users in Immediate Vicinity (300 m)**

   - Park corridor visitors within ~300–400 m: estimated **2,000–3,000 people/day** in suitable weather
   - Not all pass through your building; estimate **10–15%** either pass the building entrance or see café signage.
     - Use **12%**: 2,500 × 12% ≈ 300 potential entrants/day
   - Conversion to purchase: **20–30%**
     - Use **25%**: 300 × 25% ≈ **75 customers/day**

3. **Office Workers within 500–800 m**

   - Eco‑business workers in 1 km: ~40,000
   - Realistic walking radius to your building for a coffee (10–12 min walk round trip acceptable at lunch) is **~600–800 m**, not all offices.
   - Assume **35%** of these workers are within practical access distance:
     - 40,000 × 35% ≈ 14,000 accessible office workers
   - Daily office workers present: assume **1.0 occupancy factor** on weekdays (hybrid, business travel, etc.) ≈ 14,000/day.
   - Penetration for **a single café in a non‑mall, park location**:
     - Assume **3–5%** of accessible workers purchase from this shop on an average weekday (mix of coffee breaks, lunch, take‑away)
     - Use **4%**: 14,000 × 4% ≈ **560 customers/day (weekday)**  
   - To convert to an *average across the week* (weekend office traffic much lower):
     - Assume 5 workdays at 560/d, 2 weekend days at 100/d from offices:
       - Weekly office customers ≈ (560×5 + 100×2) = 3,000
       - Daily average ≈ **430 customers/day**

4. **Nearby Residents within 500 m**

   - Residential population within 500 m: 14,430
   - Adult population (15+): 14,430 – ~1,255 (children) ≈ 13,175 adults
   - Coffee consumption frequency assumption:
     - **5–8%** of adults visit this specific café per week (location is across road and inside a cultural building)
     - Use **6%**: 13,175 × 6% ≈ 790 unique adult customers/week
   - Average weekly visits per such resident: **1.3** (some once, some twice)
     - Weekly transactions from nearby residents: 790 × 1.3 ≈ 1,027
     - Daily average ≈ **150 customers/day**

**Deterministic base customers per day (average over a week)**

- Exhibition visitors: ~150
- Park users (immediate): ~75
- Office workers: ~430
- Nearby residents (≤500 m): ~150

**Total deterministic average ≈ 805 customers/day**

This is an upper‑bound for a **well‑operated, visible café** inside the building. For planning safety, you could also consider a **“lower bound”** using 70% of these figures:

- 805 × 70% ≈ **560 customers/day** as a cautious planning base.

---

### 5.2 Additional Potential (Less Certain, Upside)

1. **Broader 1 km Resident Ring (beyond 500 m)**

- Residents within 1,000 m: 64,316
- Already counted 14,430 within 500 m → incremental 49,886 residents.
- Adults ≈ 91% (subtracting 9% children) → ~45,397 adults.

If the café becomes a **known destination**:

- Assume **1–2%** of these adults visit per week:
  - 45,397 × 1.5% (midpoint) ≈ 681 unique adult customers/week
- With 1.3 visits/person/week average:
  - 681 × 1.3 ≈ 885 additional weekly visits
  - Daily average ≈ **125 additional customers/day**

2. **Metro Commuter Detours**

- Beixinjing station daily entries+exits: assume **35,000/day**
- Share who regularly use the Suzhou Riverfront path and might discover the café: say **5–8%**
  - Use 6.5% → 2,275 potential frequent passers
- Share who would actually **detour** to the café (actual extra walk, not in a mall): **5–10%**
  - Use 7%: ≈ 160 commuters/day

3. **Events / Group Bookings in Exhibition Hall**

- If the building regularly hosts corporate events, small conferences, photo exhibitions, etc., a café can capture:
  - 20–50 additional group customers per event
  - Assuming 5–8 such events/month → monthly +150–400 customers, only **+5–15 customers/day** on average, but big **peaks** on event days.

---

## 6. Customer Number Estimation

### 6.1 Consolidated Daily Customer Estimates

**Deterministic (average week‑day mix)**

Using the cautious scaling (70% of earlier detailed estimate):

- Base deterministic:
  - Exhibition: 150 × 0.7 ≈ 105
  - Park users: 75 × 0.7 ≈ 53
  - Office workers: 430 × 0.7 ≈ 301
  - Nearby residents (≤500 m): 150 × 0.7 ≈ 105

**Deterministic planning base ≈ 105 + 53 + 301 + 105 ≈ 564 customers/day**

Rounded to **~560–600 customers/day** as a realistic planning benchmark for a well‑run café with:
- Clear wayfinding from ground level
- Good visibility from the exhibition circulation

**Potential Upside (full ramp‑up, strong brand & operations)**

Add likely upside segments:

- 1 km residential ring beyond 500 m: +125/day
- Metro commuter detours: +160/day
- Occasional events: +10/day average

**Total potential ≈ 564 + 125 + 160 + 10 ≈ 859 customers/day**

Rounded to **~800–900 customers/day** as a **maximum achievable** under good conditions (weather, marketing, quality, and minimal internal competition in the same building).

### 6.2 Coffee Transactions & Revenue Context (Optional)

If average:
- **Spend per customer**: 35–45 RMB (coffee 25–35 + snack add‑ons)
- Use 40 RMB average.

Then:
- At **560 customers/day** → 560 × 40 ≈ **22,400 RMB/day**
- At **850 customers/day** → 34,000 RMB/day

These are purely indicative and do not include seat turnover constraints (3F location may limit passing quick traffic).

---

## 7. Pros & Cons of the Location (Customer Perspective)

### Pros (Quantified)

- **Dense surrounding population:**
  - 14,430 residents within 500 m
  - 64,316 residents within 1 km
  - ~39,000 working‑age within 1 km → strong base for daily consumption.

- **Large office daytime population:**
  - ~40,000 office workers estimated within 1 km eco‑business cluster
  - ~14,000 within realistic walking distance, generating ~300–560 daily customers in reasonable scenarios.

- **Cultural & park clustering:**
  - Multiple parks (at least 5 within 300–900 m)
  - One exhibition hall (your building) + nearby museums (科技金融博物馆 etc.)
  - Expected **park corridor 2,000–3,000 visitors/day**, plus ~700–800 exhibition visitors/day.

- **Transport accessibility:**
  - Metro interchanges (Beixinjing L2/L15) within ~700 m; daily 30–40k station users
  - Several bus routes via Guangfu West Rd and 丹巴路

- **Demographic fit:**
  - 61% of local population 15–59 yrs; core coffee consumption age
  - Significant older population (19.7% 65+) → daytime leisure use

### Cons / Risks

- **3rd‑floor, non‑street‑front location:**
  - Requires **effective signage and wayfinding** from park paths and building entrance
  - Without strong branding or in‑building orientation, many potential customers may never reach L3.

- **Weather sensitivity:**
  - Park and riverfront traffic (2,000–3,000/day) is **highly affected by rain, cold, heat** → daily volatility in customer numbers.

- **Competition from malls / other F&B:**
  - Several malls within 700–900 m (PARK11, 宜家荟聚, 复邦汇, 申亚·悦庭18, etc.) with established coffee chains (Starbucks, Luckin, etc.)
  - Office workers may prefer **malls attached directly to their office buildings** rather than walking to the riverfront.

- **Visitor flow dependence on exhibition operation:**
  - If the Industrial Civilization Exhibition Hall has fluctuating opening hours, limited promotion, or temporary closures, the deterministic 100–150 daily visitors from this stream can shrink quickly.

---

## 8. Summary

- **Core catchment**:  
  - 500 m: 14.4k residents + park users + part of eco‑business workers  
  - 1 km: 64.3k residents + ~40k office workers in Changfeng Eco‑Business Area + large flows to Beixinjing metro station.

- **Deterministic customer number (reasonable planning figure):**
  - **~560–600 customers/day** on average across the week, assuming:
    - Good signage
    - Average brand strength
    - Normal weather patterns

- **Potential maximum customer number (under strong operations & awareness):**
  - **~800–900 customers/day**, through:
    - Deeper penetration into 1 km residential base
    - Capturing more office workers and metro detours
    - Leveraging events and active programming in the exhibition hall and greenbelt.

In numerical terms, the location offers **substantial customer potential**, but realizing the upper range will depend heavily on:
- Visibility and access to the 3rd floor,
- Cooperation with exhibition operations (joint tickets, package deals, event catering),
- Strong positioning as a **“riverside / cultural destination café”** beyond just serving internal exhibition visitors.
