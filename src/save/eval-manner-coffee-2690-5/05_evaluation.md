# Evaluation Scores

## Customer Analysis: 3.2/10
The report demonstrates that the site has respectable absolute surrounding populations and office stock, but when evaluated under the rubric’s stricter definitions (repeat users passing within ~30–40 m of the storefront on natural paths and a fixed 3‑hour morning window), the effective customer potential is weak. The café is on the 3rd floor inside an exhibition building in a park corridor, not on any main commuter path; most office workers and residents must make a deliberate multi‑minute detour plus level changes, so true repeat passers at the door and deterministic repeat cups fall into the 3.0–4.9 band, scored at 4.0. Morning‑peak strength is very limited because the building and park are not primary 07:30–10:30 funnels, yielding an estimated <30 cups and <700 passers in that window, so 1.5. Leisure demand from ~700–800 museum visitors/day and nearby park traffic does exist, but only a subset reaches the L3 corridor, so reachable leisure passers likely stay below 3,000/day, justifying a 2.5. Storefront exposure is poor: the report itself highlights that this is a destination café, 3F, non‑street‑front, heavily dependent on signage and cooperation with the exhibition, which matches the “<10% of relevant flows and multiple level changes” band at 3.5. On competition, the micro‑node (museum + immediate park flows) appears to have little direct coffee competition, even though malls within 700–900 m host chains; given modest deterministic node demand but low direct competition, a mid–high score of 6.5 is appropriate. The broader eco‑business district and municipal park/museum anchors are structurally stable with some long‑term upside, but weather sensitivity and dependence on a single exhibition hall prevent a top score, so stability is rated 7.8. Demographically, the area has a high share of working‑age residents and many white‑collar office workers, with nearby malls and existing coffee chains indicating good income and coffee habits, giving a strong but not perfect price‑fit at 7.8. Applying the rubric weights, these sub‑scores yield an overall customer‑potential score of 3.2, reflecting that while the node around the building is attractive in aggregate, the specific 3F internal placement severely limits realistically reachable repeat traffic, especially in the morning, and the global caps linked to weak repeat and morning bases are binding.

## Traffic & Accessibility: 4.0/10
The site has strong macro fundamentals (dense 1 km catchment, multiple transit options, and abundant nearby parking) but is structurally weak for pure weekday-morning commuter coffee. For A, effective morning pass‑by at storefront is very low (~3rd floor in a park, not street-front, dependent on park and museum flows which are weaker 07:00–10:00), fitting the 1,000–2,999 band, so 2.0. For B, most office and metro commuters must take a clear detour through the riverside greenbelt; office workers within ~150–450 m face roughly 3–7 minutes total walk and several turns, and metro→office commuters have to deviate from their direct paths, which aligns with a moderate 4–7 minute extra detour for a large share of users, so 5.0. For C, the broader area has around 40,000 office workers plus many residents, giving meaningful weekday peaks even though the unit itself is in a leisure-oriented park/exhibition setting, consistent with a commuter-strong mixed profile (7.5). For D, two metro lines are within 650–800 m with 30–40k total station volume, but only a small fraction naturally route via the park and building, so relevant captured volume is modest and capped to the 5–6 “moderate” range (5.5). For E, total base within 1 km is high (≈64k residents + 40k workers ≈ 104k), squarely in dense urban (8.0). For F, captive on-site population is minimal—the café is in an exhibition building without large directly connected workplaces or hotel towers, so <1,000 true captive users and a score of 1.5. For G, the 3rd-floor placement inside a park with reliance on vertical circulation and signage, and no direct alignment with any metro–office or home–station spine, implies weak in-project visibility (3.5). For H, 1,000–1,400 parking spaces within ~300 m and straightforward road access support good car accessibility (7.5). The weighted average of these dimension scores yields an overall traffic & accessibility score of about 4.0/10, comfortably below all global caps and reflecting a fundamentally destination-style, visibility-constrained site despite strong surrounding density and access options.

## Competition Analysis: 6.0/10
The report presents a detailed, internally consistent view suggesting an RSV in the upper-adequate band: while it asserts 560–600 (up to 800–900) cups/day are possible, its own numbers show only ~2,700–3,800 exhibition/park users “already downstairs” plus a detour segment of 700–1,400 white-collar workers; given a non-CBD leisure node, a realistic penetration and low on-path share, this aligns better with a conservative 450–600 cups/day range, so Effective Node Volume is scored at 6.3. Saturation is clearly high: roughly 26–29 direct coffee outlets within 1 km, 6 within 500 m (including a co-located Manner and nearby Luckin, Starbucks, Tims), and the author explicitly calls the area “咖啡高度集中” and “接近饱和”; per-capita, this implies well over 2.5 outlets per 10k effective users, so saturation is judged Poor at 4.0 rather than extreme, as there is no evidence of >50 outlets in 500 m or widespread weak units. Positioning white space is relatively strong: the analysis convincingly argues for a differentiated “文化+景观+亲子/轻办公” role distinct from fast commuter chains and mall cafés, with a unique riverfront + museum 3F context and programmatic potential (events, exhibitions, family use), supporting a Good score of 7.5. Anchor/incumbent risk is material but not catastrophic: a Manner is essentially co-located in the same exhibition complex and strong chains (Luckin, Starbucks, Tims) sit within 500–1,000 m and dominate value/commuter and office coffee, but there is no flagship hero unit on the exact same flow and the proposed use cases only partially overlap, so this dimension is rated Adequate at 6.0. Combining these with the rubric weights yields a final net competitive favorability score of 6.0, consistent with an upper-adequate, but not top-tier, node for a differentiated coffee-led concept.
