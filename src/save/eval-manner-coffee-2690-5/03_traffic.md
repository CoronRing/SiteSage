## Public transit availability

**1. Metro**

- Nearest station: **北新泾站 (Beixinjing, Lines 2 & 15)**
  - Main station coordinates: ~31.2164, 121.3740
  - Straight‑line distance from store: **≈580–700 m**
  - Walking distance along streets / park paths: **≈650–800 m**, about **8–10 minutes** at 4.5–5 km/h
  - Daily ridership: **≈30,000–40,000 entries+exits/day** (city stats; previous analysis consistent)
- Secondary metro influence:
  - **威宁路站 (Weining Rd, Line 2)**: ~880–920 m away; about **12–15 minutes walk**
  - Will contribute mainly occasional visitors and some office commuters walking via Changshou Rd / parks.

**2. Bus**

Within **~800–900 m** there is a dense bus network; key stops near the store (distance is from the coffee shop building):

- **光复西路丹巴路站** – 161 m north‑east
- **北新泾(公交站)** – 256 m south‑west
- **天山路哈密路站** – 526 m south
- **云岭东路丹巴路站 / 丹巴路云岭东路站** – ~530 m north‑east
- Multiple stops on:

## Customer flow analysis

### 1. Main customer bases (from previous analysis)

Within 1 km:

- Residents: **≈64,316 people**
  - 15–59岁：≈39,243  
  - 65+：≈12,646
- Office workers: **≈40,000**, with **≈14,000** within comfortable walking radius.
- Park/riverfront visitors near site: **≈2,000–3,000人/日（好天气）**
- Exhibition hall visitors: **≈700–800人/日**

Estimated “deterministic” average demand (already modeled):

- **≈560–600 客/日（周均）**
  - 展馆：100–150/日
  - 公园/河道：50–75/日
  - 办公：300–430/日
  - 500 m居民：100–150/日  
- 上探潜力（品牌+导视+活动）：**≈800–900 客/日**

### 2. How these customers physically arrive

#### a. Metro → park corridor → store

From **北新泾站** (Lines 2 & 15):

- Typical route (8–10 min walk, ~650–800 m):
  1. Exit at **south / southeast exits (1, 2, 5)**.
  2. Walk north‑east toward **双流路 / 云岭东路 / 丹巴路**.
  3. Enter the Suzhou Creek riverside greenbelt.
  4. Follow the **east‑running or north‑bank path** to reach the preserved building where the coffee shop is located (3rd floor).

Who uses this:

- **Office commuters** working in 长风生态商务区 / 慧山科技园 and nearby complexes, grabbing coffee:
  - Before work / en‑route: small portion will **detour via riverfront**, mainly if they enjoy a scenic route.
  - After work / evenings: higher tolerance for scenic detour.
- **Residential users** from 1–2 km radius coming on weekends:
  - Take metro to 北新泾 → walk through park → coffee + stroll.

Given 北新泾站 daily **30k–40k** flows, even **2–3%** choosing the riverfront path and **5–10%** of those stopping at the shop yields:

- 30,000 × 2% × 7% ≈ **42 customers/day** from metro‑park passer‑by flow (conservative).

#### b. Bus → Guangfu West Rd → riverfront → store

From **光复西路丹巴路站** (161 m):

- Walk **south ≈150–200 m (2–3 min)** through side streets / plaza.
- Enter riverside greenbelt just north of the building → access the Industrial Civilization Exhibition Hall.
- This route is almost a direct line; detour is minimal (see next section).

From **北新泾公交站** (256 m, south‑west):

- Walk **north‑east 3–4 min** via local streets.
- Cross Guangfu West Rd if needed, then enter riverfront park.

Major users:

- Residents in adjacent **high‑rise communities north of Guangfu West Rd**.
- Office workers off main bus lines using lunch breaks or after‑work.

#### c. Office cluster north of Guangfu West Rd → store

Key office/commercial sites (e.g., 慧山科技园、旭辉世纪广场、苏宁天御国际广场) lie **150–400 m north / north‑east** of the coffee shop.

- Typical path:
  1. Exit office tower lobby to **光复西路** or inner plazas.
  2. Walk **south 150–250 m (2–4 min)** to the riverfront entrances.
  3. Enter park and reach the preserved building; internal wayfinding to 3rd floor.

Distance & time:

- **200–450 m**, depending on building position.
- **3–7 min** walk; nearly straight‑line.

This is the backbone of **workday demand**:

- Within ~500 m effective radius: **≈14,000 workers**.
- If **15–20%** of them buy at least **1 coffee/week** on site:
  - 14,000 × 0.17 ÷ 7 ≈ **340 daily transactions** just from nearby offices (order of magnitude matches prior 300–430 estimate).

#### d. Residents north of Guangfu West Rd / nearby complexes

Residential towers are **immediately north** across 光复西路 and extend within **500–800 m**.

- North‑bank residents:
  - Cross minor internal streets, sometimes cross 光复西路 at signalized points.
  - 200–600 m walk → **3–8 min**.
  - Riverfront & exhibition hall perceived as a neighborhood leisure destination (after dinner, weekends).
- 500 m内约14,430 residents:
  - Assume 15–59岁（约60.7%）≈ **8,760人**为主要消费群。
  - 若每人每月平均光顾1次：8,760 ÷ 30 ≈ **290客/日**潜在；按实际渗透系数 30–40% → **≈90–120客/日**（与前期测算一致）。

#### e. Park / riverfront / exhibition hall visitors

- Riverfront greenbelt: **≈2,000–3,000人/日（好天气）**
- Exhibition hall: **≈700–800人/日**

On‑site behavior:

- These people **already pass next to or inside the same building**.
- If:
  - 25–30% of exhibition visitors consume coffee/snacks → **≈175–240客/日**
  - 5–10% of park visitors step into the 3F coffee shop (signage & family‑friendliness matter) → **≈100–250客/日**

Realized numbers (from previous conservative model): **展馆+公园≈150–225客/日** are reasonable.

## Detour estimation (with static map)

Static map (marker A = coffee shop):

![Static map – approach routes](https://restapi.amap.com/v3/staticmap?location=121.379449%2C31.220675&zoom=15&size=512%2A512&markers=mid%2C%2CA%3A121.379449%2C31.220675%7Cmid%2C%2CM%3A121.3734%2C31.2225%7Cmid%2C%2CB%3A121.384%2C31.2175%7Cmid%2C%2CO%3A121.382%2C31.224%7Cmid%2C%2CR%3A121.377%2C31.2165&key=68913ce8db83f7bbe5b4cca9720c7a8f)

- **A** – Coffee shop (Industrial Civilization Exhibition Hall, 3F)  
- **M** – Example metro access / park gateway to the west  
- **B** – Bus / road access to the south‑east  
- **O** – Office / commercial cluster to the north‑east  
- **R** – Residential / bus node to the south‑west  

### 1. 5‑minute detour range

Assume urban walking speed ≈ **80 m/min** (4.8 km/h):

- 5 min ≈ **400 m** effective detour radius (accounting for crossings & paths).

Who is inside a **≤400 m additional detour** to visit the coffee shop?

- **Office workers**:
  - Many offices lie **150–450 m** away; lunch or coffee run is within 3–7 min.
  - For someone already walking **between metro and office**, stepping **100–200 m off** the straight line is only **1–3 min** extra.
- **Bus riders on Guangfu West Rd**:
  - 光复西路丹巴路站 at 161 m: **≈2 min**.
  - 北新泾公交站 at 256 m: **≈3–4 min**.
- **Residents in the immediately adjacent towers** north of Guangfu West:
  - 200–400 m: typically **3–6 min**.

Estimated people whose **home/office/bus stop** sits within 5‑min EXTRA walk to the shop:

- Offices within ~400 m: **≈8,000–10,000 workers**
- Residents within ~400 m: **≈7,000–9,000 people** (subset of the 14,430 within 500 m)
- Daily bus boardings/alightings at the nearest 3–4 stops: likely **7,000–10,000** (typical for inner‑ring Shanghai corridors)

Realistic “addressable” 5‑min detour population per weekday (factoring overlap & those who actually pass nearby daily):

- **≈10,000–15,000 individuals/day** have routes that can include the shop with ≤5 min detour.

If **4–6%** of them choose to stop on any given day:

- 10,000 × 4% = **400 customers/day**
- 15,000 × 6% = **900 customers/day** upper bound  
This aligns with the modeled **560–900 客/日** envelope.

### 2. 10‑minute detour range

10 min ≈ **800 m** effective detour.

This adds:

- Remaining **1 km office population**: up to **≈40,000 workers** total.
- The full **14,430 residents** in 500 m, and the majority of the **64,316 residents** within 1 km.
- A larger share of **北新泾地铁全量客流** (many could swing via the park route).

Estimated people who could **practically include the coffee shop in an 800 m / 10‑min detour** on workdays:

- **≈25,000–35,000 individuals/day** (commuters + residents + park users within 1 km).

At a modest **1.5–3%** per‑day visitation rate:

- 25,000 × 1.5% = **375 customers/day**
- 35,000 × 3% = **1,050 customers/day**

Again, the band broadly supports the **600–900日均客流潜力** if product/brand and signage are executed well.

## Visibility analysis

### 1. Macroscopic visibility

- The building is **inside a greenbelt**, not on the main road frontage:
  - Not directly exposed to **光复西路车行流量**.
  - Visibility is strongest for:
    - People already in the **riverside park corridor**.
    - Visitors to the **Industrial Civilization Exhibition Hall** and nearby cultural facilities.
- From the main roads:
  - Drivers on **光复西路** and those on the **nearby Suzhou Creek bridge / interchange** will see the greenbelt but **not necessarily the 3F coffee shop** without signage.
  - Good scope for **road‑side and intersection signage / banners** at main park entrances.

### 2. Internal (park + building) visibility

- Within the **riverside promenade**:
  - Pedestrians can see the preserved building fairly clearly as a landmark.
  - However, the coffee shop being on the **3rd floor** means:
    - Ground‑level eye‑catching signs, vertical banners, and **glass façade with interior lighting** become critical.
- Exhibition hall:
  - Visitors must be **guided up** (vertical circulation).  
  - If elevators and main staircases are well‑signed (“3F Coffee & River View Lounge”), conversion from museum visitors could be significant.

### 3. Competing nodes

- Nearby malls (旭辉·悦庭18广场、苏宁荟聚广场、PARK11 等) have:
  - Higher **external visibility** (street‑front, big signage).
  - Strong chain coffee competition.
- The coffee shop’s key differentiator is **river view + cultural venue** rather than raw footfall exposure.

## Summary: Pros & Cons of the location (traffic perspective)

**Pros (traffic & accessibility)**

- **Multi‑modal access:**
  - **2 metro lines** (北新泾 Line 2 & 15, 威宁路 Line 2 influence) within **8–15 min** walk.
  - **≥10 bus stops within 800–900 m**, with 2 key stops within **300 m**.
- **High density catchment:**
  - **≈64,000+ residents** within 1 km, **≈40,000 office workers**, plus **2,000–3,000 park visitors/day** and **700–800 museum visitors/day**.
- **Short detours for key segments:**
  - Office and bus users: **3–7 min** detour typical to reach the shop.
  - Estimated **10,000–15,000 daily individuals** within **≤5 min** extra walk range.
- **Strong car access:**
  - **≈1,000–1,400 parking spaces** within 300 m.
  - Good access from nearby road interchange on Suzhou Creek corridor.
- **Pleasant approach experience:**
  - Routes largely through **greenbelts and riverside promenade**, which supports a **destination café / “third place”** positioning.

**Cons / Risks**

- **Not street‑front:**
  - Hidden inside park + 3rd floor → **weak spontaneous visibility** from road traffic.
  - Reliant on **signage, online discovery, and word‑of‑mouth** to convert ambient flows into visits.
- **Vertical access dependency:**
  - Must ensure **clear, intuitive vertical circulation** from park level to 3F.
  - If elevators, stairs, and indoor wayfinding are confusing, a noticeable portion of casual park visitors may never reach the café.
- **Weather sensitivity:**
  - Park and riverfront flows (≈2,000–3,000人/日) can drop sharply in **rain, heat, cold**; sales need a stable base from residents + offices.
- **Strong competition in nearby malls:**
  - For quick, purely functional coffee, some white‑collar workers may prefer **in‑mall or in‑office chain brands** with direct lobby access.
  - Your advantage must be: **environment, view, seating quality, and experience**.

**Overall traffic potential conclusion**

- Access by **public transit, foot, and car is strong in numerical terms**: a combined reachable population of **tens of thousands per day** within a **10‑minute detour radius**.
- The main **bottleneck is visibility and vertical access**, not raw people flow.  
- If well‑signed and positioned as a **riverfront leisure + cultural café** serving:
  - ~**300–430 办公客/日**
  - ~**100–150 周边居民客/日**
  - ~**150–225 展馆+公园客/日**
  
  then a stable **560–600 客/日**, with upside to **800–900 客/日**, is consistent with the traffic and detour metrics above.
