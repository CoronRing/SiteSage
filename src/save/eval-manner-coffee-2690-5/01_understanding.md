The requested coffee shop location is geocoded to an existing coffee shop, **Manner Coffee (苏州河文明展示馆店)**, at the third floor of a preserved building inside **长风五号公共绿地 / 长风生态商务区** along **光复西路** in Shanghai’s **Putuo District**.

**Spatial context:**
- The point sits in a **riverside cultural and park setting** on a bend of **Suzhou River (苏州河十八湾)**.
- **North** of the point, across Guangfu West Road, lie multiple **high‑rise residential/office complexes** such as 苏宁天御国际广场 buildings, indicating a dense local population and office presence within a short walk.
- **East** of the point is **长风生态商务区4号滨河绿地**, a landscaped **riverside greenbelt** inside the eco‑business district, suggesting steady recreational and office-worker foot traffic nearby.
- **South** of the location is directly the **riverside edge of Suzhou River** and, slightly further, a significant **road interchange** carrying major arterials (including 长宁路), providing strong vehicular access from a wider catchment.
- **West** appears as additional **green, park‑like open space**, continuing the riverfront recreational corridor.

Overall, the location is a **cultural/tourism and leisure node** embedded between:
- **Residential/office towers to the north**,
- **Eco‑business and parklands to the east**, and
- **Major transport infrastructure to the south**,

which together support diverse visitor sources: local residents, office workers, and visitors to the exhibition hall and riverfront.
