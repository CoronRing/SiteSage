# Weighting Rationale

- **Store type:** Coffee Shop / Café located on the 3rd floor of an Industrial Civilization Exhibition Hall in the Changfeng Eco-Business Area (Shanghai).
- **Business model context:**
  - Primarily serves exhibition visitors, employees and visitors of nearby offices/businesses, and people already within the complex.
  - Likely mix of planned visits (people already in the building) and opportunistic purchases (visitors deciding to get coffee while on-site).

- **Customer (0.30):**
  - Broad, mixed customer base (exhibition visitors, office workers, business-area visitors) rather than a narrow niche.
  - Demographics and usage patterns (e.g., office-worker daytime demand, event-driven peaks) matter, but the concept is not highly specialized.
  - Aligned with rubric: coffee shop with general but somewhat defined audience → moderate customer weight.

- **Traffic & Accessibility (0.40):**
  - Critical question is whether enough people flow through the exhibition hall and eco-business area, and how easily they can find and access a 3rd-floor café.
  - Vertical accessibility (elevators/escalators, signage) and internal wayfinding are key, since the shop is not at street level.
  - Dependent on building/event traffic, office occupancy, and connectivity to transit and pedestrian flows.
  - Matches rubric for coffee shops relying on daily and opportunistic visits → higher traffic/accessibility weight.

- **Competition (0.30):**
  - Coffee and beverage competition in Shanghai is generally strong, but being inside a specific exhibition hall and eco-business complex narrows the immediate competitive set to on-site or very nearby options.
  - Need to assess presence of other cafés, tea shops, and beverage kiosks in the building and surrounding complex, but location constraints and captive demand reduce pure price/brand competition somewhat.
  - This supports a moderate competition weight, in line with rubric guidance for coffee shops in competitive but somewhat bounded environments.

- **Overall balance:**
  - **Traffic & Accessibility (0.40)** is prioritized because the in-building, upper-floor location makes sufficient, convenient visitor flow the primary success factor.
  - **Customer (0.30)** and **Competition (0.30)** are kept balanced and moderate, reflecting a broad target base and a competitive yet partially captive micro-market inside the exhibition/business complex.
