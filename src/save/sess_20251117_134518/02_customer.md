## Data Quality & Limitations

- This analysis uses population data generated from the WorldPop provider, which should be reliable; however, specific local nuances like specific resident interests, competing businesses, and transient population characteristics (e.g., tourists) are not captured.
- Population estimates at finer distances may have rounding or estimation inaccuracies.
- Any changes in local infrastructure, resident influx or outflow, and business environment dynamics (such as new competitors) can affect these numbers and the overall customer landscape.
