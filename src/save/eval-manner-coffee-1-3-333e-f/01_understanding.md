# Understanding

- You plan to open a **coffee shop** inside **港汇恒隆广场 (Grand Gateway 66)**, specifically at **上海虹桥路1号港汇恒隆广场3楼南北座长廊333E/F（靠近内外）**.
- The geocoded location corresponds to **港汇恒隆广场北座** in **徐汇区徐家汇商圈** of Shanghai.

## Spatial context

- The marker lies **inside the Grand Gateway 66 North Tower**, part of a large mixed-use commercial complex.
- Immediately to the **north**, across internal roads and plazas, is the **徐家汇交通枢纽/地铁站区域**, with multiple metro entrances and a major elevated road corridor running roughly east–west.
- To the **east and north‑east**, the rest of the **港汇恒隆广场购物中心** extends with many retail and brand stores; your location is within short indoor walking distance of these tenants.
- To the **south and south‑east**, within the same complex and adjacent blocks, are additional **high‑end retail and fashion brands**, forming a dense commercial environment.
- To the **west and south‑west**, across internal streets and near metro exits, are more **commercial buildings and restaurants**, reachable within a brief walk from your unit.

Overall, the coffee shop will be in a **high‑density commercial and transport hub (徐家汇)** with strong pedestrian flows from the mall, nearby office towers, and the metro interchange.
