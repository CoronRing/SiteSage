## Public transit availability

**1. Metro (core driver)**

- Nearest station: **徐家汇站 (Lines 1, 9, 11)** – directly under/around Grand Gateway.
- Key exits and distances to the mall block (straight-line, from tools):
  - 综合站点 “徐家汇(地铁站)” at ~**51 m** from store coordinates.
  - Exit cluster around the mall within **50–200 m**:
    - 17号口: 92 m  
    - 19号口: 92 m  
    - 18号口: 122 m  
    - 16号口: 151 m  
    - 12B号口: 160 m  
    - 12A号口: 166 m  
    - 15号口: 186 m  
    - 13号口: 194 m  
    - 11号口: 213 m  
    - 14号口: 293 m  
    - 10号口: ~305–315 m  
    - 8号口: 330 m
- Operational implication:
  - Practically **all metro exits are within 2–5 minutes walking** to a Grand Gateway entrance.
  - 3F coffee shop is **one vertical circulation segment** (escalators/elevators) above these flows.
- Metro daily volume:
  - Previous analysis: **30–50 万人次/日 (300,000–500,000)** for 徐家汇站.
  - Even if only **10–20%** of station traffic enters Grand Gateway: **30,000–100,000 人次/日** feeding the mall.

**2. Bus**

Within a **300 m** radius:

- Bus stops:
  - “昭平路恭城路(公交站)” – 181 m
  - “虹桥路恭城路(公交站)” – 213 m
  - “广元西路华山路(公交站)” – 272 m
  - “徐家汇(华山路)(公交站)” – 265 m
  - “嵩嘉浜路天平路(徐家汇)(公交站)” – 325 m
- These are on main radials (虹桥路, 广元西路, 华山路等), typically serving **8–15 lines** in total around the node.
- Realistically, **thousands to low tens of thousands** of bus passengers per day within easy walking reach of the mall.

**Transit summary (quantitative)**

- Within ~300 m: **1 metro hub + ≥5 bus stops**, all ≤5 min walk to mall entrances.
- Time from platform → store:
  - Platform → closest exit: ~2–5 min
  - Exit → mall entrance (Grand Gateway): ~1–2 min
  - Mall entrance → 3F unit 333E/F: ~2–4 min (escalators/wayfinding)
  - **Total typical: 5–10 min from metro platform to coffee shop.**

## Parking availability

The site is car-accessible via multiple structured and surface car parks within **200–250 m**:

- Directly attached to Grand Gateway:
  - “港汇恒隆广场地下停车场(出入口)” – 54 m
  - “港汇恒隆广场地下停车场 / 出入口” – 143–151 m
- Adjacent public and mall car parks (≤220 m):
  - “港汇花园停车场” + 出入口 – 91–105 m  
  - 地面停车场 (surface) – 116–119 m
  - “停车场” at 31.195344,121.435185 – 135 m
  - ITC2 期入口 / TWO ITC 地下停车场 – 152–214 m
  - “徐家汇中心地下停车场” – 199 m
  - 汇银广场、百联徐汇商业广场等停车场/出口 – 172–186 m
  - 多处公共/路侧停车位 (流行线步行街、名仕苑等) – 140–200 m

Conservative capacity estimate within **300 m** (summing large garages and surface lots):

- Grand Gateway + Xujiahui Center + ITC + surrounding malls:
  - Each large complex: roughly **500–1,200** spaces.
  - 4–5 such facilities → approx. **2,000–4,000 parking spaces**.
- Even at **weekday peak 70–85% occupancy**, availability remains in the **300–1,000 space** band at most times.

Parking → store walking:

- Garage exit → mall entrance: **1–3 min**.
- Mall entrance → 3F store: **2–4 min**.
- **Total: 3–7 min** from car to store.

### 2. Flows and directions

Using the static map:

![Static map – Grand Gateway & surroundings](https://restapi.amap.com/v3/staticmap?location=121.436572%2C31.195053&zoom=16&size=512%2A512&markers=mid%2C%2CA%3A121.436572%2C31.195053%7Cmid%2C%2CS%3A121.4379%2C31.1941%7Cmid%2C%2CS%3A121.4348%2C31.1934%7Cmid%2C%2CS%3A121.4374%2C31.196%7Cmid%2C%2CO%3A121.4395%2C31.1946&key=68913ce8db83f7bbe5b4cca9720c7a8f)

- A = Grand Gateway (港汇恒隆广场) – your mall.
- S = nearby office / commercial blocks (e.g., ITC, 徐家汇中心、西侧写字楼群等).
- O = eastern multi-mall / department store cluster.

**Typical paths:**

1. **Metro → Office (morning & evening peaks)**
   - From 徐家汇站 exits 17/18/19/20 to:
     - North & northwest (ITC、写字楼): via elevated deck + sidewalks → pass by Grand Gateway or under its podium.
     - West & southwest (徐家汇中心、西部办公楼): via west-side sidewalks & exits 19/20.
   - Share of these flows that can walk through or by Grand Gateway:
     - If even **15–25%** of office commuters choose indoor/covered mall paths for comfort, that is **9,000–22,500 人/日** office-related flows interfacing with the mall.

2. **Metro/Bus → Shopping / Dining**
   - From Lines 1/9/11 to:
     - Grand Gateway (A)
     - ITC & 汇金, 美罗城, 东方商厦, 百联广场 (O & S markers).
   - Because malls form a **cluster within ~300–600 m**, many customers loop:
     - Metro → Grand Gateway → other malls → Metro or vice versa.
   - Mall-to-mall walking times:
     - Grand Gateway → Meiluo/Metro City / 东方商厦: typically **3–7 min** via deck/ground.
   - A realistic fraction of **徐家汇站 shoppers (say 20–40%)** will walk through Grand Gateway at some point in their trip: **60,000–200,000 人次/日** of “shopping loop” potential.

3. **Office/School/Hospital → Mall (daytime)**

- Office lunch/coffee breaks:
  - Surrounding workers: **60k–90k**.
  - If **10–20%** of them enter Grand Gateway any given day: **6,000–18,000 人/日**.
  - Coffee-intent share (from prior analysis): **8,000–18,000 人/日** likely to reach 3F zone.

- Schools & hospitals:
  - Students/teachers (大学+中学): their daily trips largely via metro/bus, with:
    - After-class & weekend malls visits; many will pass through 徐家汇站.
  - Hospital visitors: may come by car/metro and use mall dining & coffee as waiting/meeting spots.
  - Combined mall-interfacing from these groups: **~3,000–8,000 人/日** reasonably.

---

## Detour estimation

Focus: people who are **already in the node** (office workers, shoppers, commuters) and how much extra time it costs to reach this 3F coffee shop.

### 1. Distance & time detour from key flows

Assume comfortable indoor walking speed ~**1.1–1.3 m/s** (mall environment).

**a) Metro commuters**

- From nearest exits (11, 12A/B, 16–19) to Grand Gateway 1F entrance:
  - Distance: **80–200 m**
  - Time: **1–3 min**
- Vertical/east-west inside the mall to 3F south-north corridor:
  - Distance (indoor): **80–200 m** on plan + 2 floors by escalator.
  - Time: **2–4 min**
- **Total marginal detour** vs. simply heading straight to another 3F store or exit:
  - If commuter is already using Grand Gateway as a passage: extra **1–3 min** to approach this specific unit.
  - If commuter routes via street and not through the mall:
    - Must enter mall + ascend → extra **3–6 min** vs. most direct outdoor path.

**b) Office workers in adjacent towers (S markers)**

- From closest office podium to Grand Gateway 3F:
  - Office to mall connection (via deck or ground): **150–350 m**,  **2–5 min**.
  - Entrance to 3F store: **2–4 min**.
- **Additional detour over “lunch out” baseline**:
  - Most will already walk **3–8 min** to food: choosing this cafe vs. other spots shifts walking time by **±0–3 min**.

**c) Cross-mall shoppers (A ↔ O cluster)**

- A (Grand Gateway) ↔ O (东方商厦/百联/美罗城一带):
  - Inter-mall walk: **250–500 m**, **3–7 min**.
- For a shopper already in Grand Gateway on any floor, extra detour to 3F corridor:
  - **1–4 min** depending on start point.

### 2. 5-min / 10-min detour catchment

Define “detour range” as **extra time** they are willing to add to their original route.

**Within +5 min detour:**

- Includes:
  - All metro passengers who already exit via 11/12/16–19 and enter/use Grand Gateway.
  - Most office workers in directly adjacent towers using pedestrian deck.
  - Shoppers already in Grand Gateway on 1–4F.
- Numbers (daily):

  - From previous analysis:
    - 3F corridor passenger flow: **~31,500 人/日**.
    - “Potential coffee-intent population” reaching Grand Gateway/3F: **8,000–18,000 人/日**.
  - Those for whom the store is within **+5 min**:
    - **All 3F corridor**: 31,500 人/日.
    - Plus a portion of people on other floors choosing to detour:
      - If **10–20%** of total mall visitors (130–160k) are willing to add ≤5 min detour for coffee on 3F:
        - **13,000–32,000 人/日** potential extra.
    - Combined **5-min detour catchment** (non-unique):  
      **~40,000–60,000 人/日** who could realistically reach the coffee shop with ≤5 min added.

**Within +10 min detour:**

- Adds:
  - More metro commuters who typically walk on the street but might enter the mall.
  - Wider office cluster within **500–800 m** (many ITC / 徐家汇中心 tenants).
  - Shoppers bouncing between multiple malls.
- If **15–30%** of 徐家汇站’s 300k–500k daily riders are willing to include any mall in a ≤10 min coffee/dining detour:
  - **45,000–150,000 人次/日** transit-based potential.
- Conservatively, fraction who specifically reach Grand Gateway & 3F:
  - Say **20–35%** of these pick Grand Gateway at some point: **9,000–52,500 人次/日**.
- Combined with existing mall visitors and office flows, the **10-min detour catchment** for your shop is roughly:
  - **60,000–100,000+ 人/日** in the node for whom this cafe is within an extra 10 min walking cost.

These ranges match your earlier estimate that **8,000–18,000 人/日** are realistic “咖啡意向人群” actually coming up to 3F; the larger catchment shows **upside** if brand/visibility is strong enough to pull a higher share.

---

## Visibility analysis

### 1. Macro-visibility (city & street level)

- Grand Gateway is at the **primary 徐家汇十字路口**, where:
  - 广元西路 / 虹桥路 (东西向主干道)  
  - 华山路 / 衡山路 / 宛平南路 (南北向主干道)
  intersect.
- Vehicle flows on surrounding arterials:
  - Each direction likely carries **tens of thousands of vehicles per day**; the node is one of Shanghai’s strongest traffic corridors.
- However, **your shop is inside the mall on 3F**, not street-facing:
  - No direct car or street pedestrian line-of-sight.
  - Macro visibility must rely on:
    - Mall directories.
    - Escalator sightlines at 3F.
    - Digital signage and in-mall wayfinding.

### 2. In-mall visibility

From previous customer analysis plus floor description:

- Location: **3F south–north main corridor**, unit **333E/F**, near store **“内外”**.
- 3F traffic:
  - Level 3 overall: ~**30%** of total mall visitors → **~45,000 人/日**.
  - South–north main corridor: ~**70%** of 3F traffic → **~31,500 人/日**.
- Per-store near-front passers-by:
  - Corridor has **~20–30 shops**; average:
    - **1,200–1,300 人/日** passing closely by the storefront.
- Visibility quality:
  - Being on a **main spine** maximizes **“seen while passing”** vs. being in a cul-de-sac.
  - However, 3F as a whole has inherently less elevator/escalator “first-touch” exposure than G/1F anchor zones.
  - Key dependency: position relative to:
    - Escalator landing points.
    - Washrooms / anchor tenants / popular F&B clusters.

If placed within the **direct line from escalators** along the main corridor, the functional visibility to 3F visitors is high; if offset or recessed, the **1,200–1,300 人/日** close passers-by remains a fair working figure.

## Summary: Pros & Cons of this location (traffic & accessibility)

### Pros

- **Exceptional public transit integration**
  - Within **≤200 m** of multiple **徐家汇站** exits for Lines 1/9/11.
  - **5–10 min** total journey from metro platform to store.
  - Dense bus network within **≤300 m**.

- **Abundant parking & car access**
  - **2,000–4,000** spaces estimated in attached/neighboring garages.
  - Car → store walking time ~**3–7 min**.
  - Suitable for destination visits and coffee meetings by drivers.

- **High underlying footfall**
  - Mall daily visitors **130,000–160,000**.
  - 3F corridor: **~31,500 人/日**.
  - Near-store passers-by: **~1,200–1,300 人/日**.
  - Coffee-intent segment compelling: **8,000–18,000 人/日**.

- **Large detour catchment**
  - ≤5 min extra walking: **~40,000–60,000 人/日** feasibly reachable.
  - ≤10 min extra walking: **≥60,000–100,000 人/日** in the node could choose this coffee shop.

- **Balanced customer mix**
  - Office workers (60k–90k nearby) for weekday peaks.
  - Shoppers & families (multi-mall cluster).
  - Students & hospital-related visitors.
  - Local residents within 1 km (~83k) for evenings/weekends.

### Cons / Constraints

- **No street-front visibility**
  - 3F interior position means **zero direct exposure** to road traffic.
  - Customer acquisition relies heavily on:
    - Mall traffic capture.
    - Signage, digital presence, and brand pull.

- **Intense competition**
  - Multiple malls (港汇, ITC, 美罗城, 东方商厦, 百联等) plus many F&B outlets.
  - Coffee/tea category highly saturated; achieving ≥5–8% share (your earlier estimate) requires differentiation.

- **Floor-level limitation**
  - 3F inherently captures **30%** of mall visitors vs. 1F anchors with higher pass-through.
  - For pure commuter grab-and-go, 1F or near-metro connections would have lower detour time; your 3F position implies **3–6 min extra** for many commuters not already aiming for upper floors.

- **Dependence on mall operations**
  - Any changes in:
    - Mall zoning.
    - Escalator arrangements.
    - Leasing mix on 3F
  can materially alter corridor traffic and your 1,200–1,300 人/日 passer-by assumption.

---

### Overall traffic potential judgment

- With the current transit, parking, and customer flows, your previous volume expectations remain consistent:
  - Baseline realistic: **100–150 单/日** after ramp-up.
  - Strong execution & better-than-average capture: **150–250 单/日**, with peaks **300+ 单** on weekends/holidays.
- The location’s **accessibility is quantitatively excellent**, but **traffic conversion will be determined by in-mall visibility, product/brand differentiation, and promotion** within the 3F corridor and to the metro/office flows in the ≤5–10 min detour band.
