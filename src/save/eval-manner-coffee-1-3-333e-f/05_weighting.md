# Weighting Rationale

- **Store type:** Coffee Shop / Café located inside Grand Gateway 66 (premium shopping mall), 3rd floor corridor.
- **Business model:** Relies on mall foot traffic (shoppers, office workers, leisure visitors) rather than being a pure destination café.

- **Customer (0.31)**
  - Coffee appeals broadly, but mall context skews toward specific segments: white-collar workers, shoppers, younger urban consumers.
  - Demographics and lifestyle (spending power, dwell time, preference for specialty coffee vs. basic drinks) influence pricing, menu, and positioning.
  - Important, but not as dominant as physical exposure to traffic.

- **Traffic & Accessibility (0.39)**
  - In a mall corridor, success is highly dependent on walk-by visibility and natural foot flow on that floor and corridor.
  - Coffee purchases are often habitual and impulse-driven; being on a well-trafficked path near complementary stores (like 内外 and other fashion/retail) is critical.
  - Vertical accessibility (escalators/elevators, proximity to anchors) and line-of-sight within the mall strongly affect daily volume.
  - Therefore, traffic/accessibility receives the highest weight within the recommended coffee shop range.

- **Competition (0.30)**
  - Malls often host multiple beverage and dessert options (other coffee chains, tea shops, juice, bakeries), so competitive density and positioning matter.
  - However, within a controlled mall environment, differentiation via brand, ambiance, and product quality can partially offset direct competition.
  - Competition is thus important but slightly less weighted than traffic and only marginally below customer fit.

- **Overall balance:**
  - Weights align with coffee shop guidelines: traffic as the top factor, with customer and competition both meaningful but secondary.
  - The in-mall, corridor-based context amplifies the importance of foot traffic and internal mall flow while still requiring a good match to the mall’s core shopper demographics.
