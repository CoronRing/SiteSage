# Evaluation Scores

## Customer Analysis: 3.8/10
The report clearly establishes that this is a top‑tier Shanghai sub‑CBD node with very strong macro footfall (Grand Gateway ~150k/day, major interchange, dense offices), but once you correctly down‑filter to people actually passing within 30–40 m of the 3F storefront, the effective repeat base is modest. The analyst’s own corridor math gives ~31,500 visitors/day on 3F and only ~1,200–1,300 “near‑door” passers for this unit; of these, a substantial share are irregular shoppers and leisure users, not high‑frequency commuters. Even if 50% were repeat users, that implies <1,000 repeat passers/day and on the order of 30–60 deterministic cups from repeat users, which fits a weak repeat base band (criterion 1 ≈ 3.5). Morning‑peak strength is particularly poor (criterion 2 ≈ 2.0) because the store is on an upper mall level, not on a station corridor or tower lobby path, and the 07:30–10:30 window is only partly within mall opening hours, so very few commuters will naturally climb to 3F on their way to work. The report’s own realistic day‑order estimates (80–150 mature, 150–250 in strong scenarios) further confirm that morning‑commuter capture is limited. For all‑day leisure flows (criterion 3 ≈ 2.5), the mall is extremely busy, but once restricted to the 30–40 m storefront zone there are only ~700–800 incremental leisure passers/day after removing repeats, supporting perhaps a few dozen incremental cups and fitting the low end of the leisure bands. Storefront exposure (criterion 4 ≈ 6.5) is moderate‑good: it sits on a main 3F spine with clear sightlines, but only captures a small fraction of node‑wide flows and requires vertical travel from the key transit and office paths, so it does not qualify as a primary conduit. Competition versus demand (criterion 5 ≈ 5.5) is tight: deterministic node‑level coffee demand in Xujiahui/Grand Gateway is huge, but there is strong saturation from Starbucks, Luckin, Manner, Seesaw, etc., and even the analyst assumes only 5–8% share for this store, consistent with a mid‑band score. Stability (criterion 6 ≈ 9.5) and demographic fit (criterion 7 ≈ 9.5) score very high, as this is a mature, resilient prime commercial district with heavy white‑collar, student, and high‑spending shopper presence and a proven coffee culture. However, because the 3F micro‑placement is weak for both repeat and morning flows, the globally weighted average of criteria 1 and 2 is far below 6 and each of them is below 5, so the overall customer‑potential score is capped well below what the macro node alone would suggest, resulting in an overall score of 3.8.

## Traffic & Accessibility: 5.2/10
The analysis shows an extremely strong node in terms of overall urban activity, transit, and parking, but the specific unit’s suitability for weekday-morning commuter coffee is only moderate. Morning pass-by at the actual storefront is likely low: even though the 3F corridor sees ~31,500 people per day and 1,200–1,300 near the unit, typical mall hours and the upper-floor position imply that only a small fraction of this occurs 07:00–10:00, consistent with a weak (3.0) A score. Detour fit is middling (5.5): commuters already traversing Grand Gateway might add just 1–3 minutes, but for the majority coming from metro to offices or street, the extra 3–6 minutes and vertical circulation are material frictions versus their shortest paths. By contrast, the composition of flows in the wider node is commuter-strong (7.5), with 60–90k nearby office workers and many students driving clear peaks, and macro transit access is excellent at the node level but only moderately captured by this interior 3F cafe (6.0), given that perhaps 10–20% of the 300k–500k station users enter the mall. The 1 km area is very dense (8.0) with roughly 110k–140k combined workers and working-age residents, and the same-complex captive base is likely several thousand tightly integrated office workers and staff (estimated 6.0) given the scale of Grand Gateway and its connected towers. Within the project, placement is on a main 3F spine with reasonable visibility to level-3 traffic (7.0) but inherently weaker than ground-level desire lines. Car access is excellent (9.0) with 2,000–4,000 nearby spaces and short walks. The low A score (<4) triggers a global cap of 5.5, but the weighted average (≈5.2) sits below this, yielding a final moderate score of 5.2, reflecting a strong overall node but a suboptimal, upper-floor mall location for peak-morning commuter capture.

## Competition Analysis: 3.6/10
The analysis itself estimates a realistic sustainable volume of roughly 150–250 cups/day (midpoint ≈200), given 1,200–1,300 direct passers on the corridor, intense on-mall competition, and the store’s L3, non-commuter-primary position. This clearly falls into the RSV <250 band, so Effective Node Volume scores as weak/failing, here set at 3.7 to reflect that there *is* substantial overall mall traffic but relatively low capture on the 0–50 m line. Saturation is described as extreme with ~25–30 coffee outlets within 300 m and ~70 within 800 m, including virtually every major chain, and the report explicitly calls the area ‘高度饱和’ with clear cannibalisation risk; in a very high-volume node the rubric suggests using a low ‘Poor’ score rather than 0–2, so 3.5 is appropriate. Positioning white space is limited: all major formats (value commuter, mass specialty, global brands, premium boutiques, sit-down café) are already present within 100 m, and the report’s suggested angles (comfortable sit-down, mid-price between Manner and Blue Bottle/Reserve, better “third space”) are incremental and execution-dependent, likely adding at most ~50–100 cups/day vs a generic offer, so this fits a ‘Poor–Adequate’ range and is scored 4.0. Anchor risk is high: a Starbucks Reserve hero unit is only ~29 m away, with Manner, Blue Bottle, %Arabica and multiple other strong chains within ~100 m on the same mall flows, matching the rubric’s ‘Poor’ band for a hero/flagship plus many strong chains tightly clustered; hence 3.0. Applying the rubric weights (65/15/10/10) yields a final score of ~3.6, below all caps set by the RSV and hero-unit gates and consistent with a highly competitive, volume-rich but low-net-favorability node for a new, non-hero coffee entrant.
