# Evaluation Scores

## Customer Analysis: 7.4/10
The report describes a flagship CBD location on East Nanjing Road with very strong fundamentals but with substantial competition and a large tourist component. For the repeat base (criterion 1), the author estimates around 290 repeat commuter/office cups plus ~60 resident cups per weekday (~350 deterministic repeat cups), consistent with the upper end of the 5.0–7.4 band; given the Grade A/B office context and dense white‑collar cluster, this is scored at 7.0 after applying the cap for a corridor where a large share of total flows is non-resident and leisure. Morning-peak strength (criterion 2) is good but not extreme: the analysis suggests roughly 210–290 morning-to-noon customers overall, with perhaps ~200–250 cups from repeat commuters in a 3-hour window, placing it in the mid–upper part of the 5.0–7.4 band; because the corridor also carries many tourists and shoppers, a within-band reduction yields 6.5. Leisure volume (criterion 3) is clearly very strong: the report cites 1.7M visitors/day for the whole road and estimates hundreds of thousands of daily passers on the core stretch, with roughly 100 deterministic tourist cups for this shop, supporting an 8.5 in the 7.5–8.9 band. Storefront exposure (criterion 4) is near-ideal: the site sits directly on the main pedestrian spine with an estimated ~300 m of frontage coverage and no detours or level changes, meaning a very high share of node flows pass within easy sight—this merits 9.5. Competitive saturation (criterion 5) is tight but not fatal: multiple Starbucks and other cafés within 300 m on a corridor with thousands of potential cups/day implies high node-wide demand but also dense supply, so a balanced 7.3 is appropriate rather than a prime score. Stability (criterion 6) is excellent (9.5), as Nanjing Road and the adjacent metro interchanges are mature, diversified anchors with little structural downside risk. Demographic and price fit (criterion 7) is also excellent (9.3): within 1 km roughly two-thirds of residents are 15–59, surrounded by offices, malls, and international brands, and the report notes a strong existing coffee/F&B culture. Weighting these subscores per the rubric yields an overall customer potential score of 7.4/10, reflecting a high-potential, high-traffic CBD coffee site with strong repeat and tourism flows but intense competition and a meaningful non-repeat component.

## Traffic & Accessibility: 7.9/10
The report supports a strong overall traffic & accessibility score dominated by very high pedestrian volumes and excellent on-path placement. For A, the segment is stated to see ~306,000 daily passers with ~76,500 between 7:00–11:00 and about 30,000 in direct visual range on this 300 m stretch; conservatively scaling to 7:00–10:00 and focusing on 0–30 m still reasonably implies 20,000–29,999 effective morning passers, i.e., an 8. For B, multiple descriptions show that metro commuters from Nanjing East Road Station, southbound office workers, and Bund–People’s Square walkers either pass directly in front of the unit or incur ≤1–3 minutes extra walking, with many flows having essentially zero detour, meeting the ≥70% within ≤2-min detour threshold for a 9. For C, the area is clearly a mixed commuter–tourist corridor: the analysis highlights 36,000 office workers within 1 km and strong commuter peaks, but also heavy tourist and leisure traffic on Nanjing Road and the Bund; this fits a commuter-strong mixed profile with substantial but not dominant commuter share, scored at 7. For D, the store sits ~80 m from Nanjing East Road Station (Lines 2 & 10) with ~300,000 daily users and very high natural capture, plus proximity to People’s Square (Lines 1/2/8) and a dense bus network, easily meeting the criteria for a super-core captured hub with relevant volume well above 200,000/day, scored at 9. For E, the report cites ~36,000 office workers and 77,398 residents within 1 km (base ≈114,000), which clearly fits the dense urban band with one strong segment (residents ≥60,000), meriting an 8. For F, while the exact counts for workers in the same podium/towers are not quantified, the store is embedded in large complexes like Hongyi International Plaza and Apple’s Nanjing East Road location, implying a meaningful but not massive captive base; a conservative estimate in the 3,000–6,999 range justifies a mid-band 5.5. For G, the unit is described as directly on the main Nanjing East Road pedestrian spine, street-facing and within the core F&B cluster near major anchors, giving it prime line-of-sight to virtually all east–west pedestrian flows and meeting the ‘prime’ criteria for a 9. For H, the area has several large nearby garages in adjacent malls and office/hotel complexes, with typical 3–8 minute walks and workable taxi/drop-off on surrounding streets (though not directly on the pedestrianized Nanjing Road), which matches the rubric’s ‘good’ band for 7. Together, these scores yield a weighted overall score of 7.9 with no global caps triggered.

## Competition Analysis: 5.8/10
The report estimates a conservative realistic output of roughly 350–450 cups/day with upside to 500–650 cups/day in a corridor seeing about 306,000 passers/day and ~30,000 effective morning-peak passers, implying a mid-band RSV around 450–500 cups/day; this fits the rubric’s ‘Upper-adequate’ 450–599 band, so Effective Node Volume is scored at 6.4. Saturation is clearly heavy: 15–18 coffee-related outlets within 0–100 m and 25–30 within 0–300 m, in line with the rubric’s ‘Poor’ band driven by ≥10 outlets in 0–100 m, but without evidence of structural collapse or many weak units, so a mid-poor score of 4.0 is appropriate. The analysis still identifies a credible but execution-dependent niche—an independent, quiet, premium ‘third-space’ café distinct from value chains (Luckin/Manner) and standard chains (Starbucks/Costa), with focus on ambiance, hand-brew, and community—suggesting some monetizable differentiation but not a large, unserved structural gap, so Positioning White Space fits the ‘Adequate’ 5.0–6.9 band and is set at 6.0. Anchor risk is high: multiple top-tier chains (Manner, Costa, several Starbucks, Luckin, M Stand, Tims, etc.) sit within ~100 m and several within ~50 m on the same flows, but there is no Reserve/Roastery-style flagship directly co-located; this matches the rubric’s ‘Poor’ condition of ≥7 strong chains within 100 m on the same corridor, so Anchor / Incumbent Risk is scored at 4.0. Weighted together, these yield a final competition-favorability score of 5.8, reflecting a high-volume but very hard-fought, red-ocean node where a new store can work only with strong differentiation and execution.
