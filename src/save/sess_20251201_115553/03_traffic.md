## 1. Public transit availability

**Key point:** The store is effectively *on top of* a major metro hub and embedded in a dense bus and pedestrian network, which is ideal for morning commuters, young professionals, and tourists.

### 1.1 Metro

- **Nearest metro station: 南京东路站 (Nanjing East Road, Lines 2 & 10)**
  - Main station centroid: ~**80 m** from the store (overlay “M” on map).
  - Closest exits around the store:
    - 2号口 / 5号口 / 7号口 and other exits are between **50–180 m** from the point (walking 1–3 minutes).
  - Access pattern:
    - Exits are on both sides of **河南中路 (Henan Middle Rd)** and along **南京东路**.
    - Walking distance from most exits to your frontage on the **south side of 南京东路步行街** is **≤200 m**.

- **人民广场站 (People’s Square, Lines 1/2/8)**
  - Rough distance: **700–900 m** west.
  - Typical walk: **9–12 minutes** at 4.5–5 km/h.
  - This hub captures a huge volume of cross-city commuters; a meaningful share (previous estimate ~15–16万人次/日) overlaps with the 南京东路步行街 flow.

- **天潼路站 (Tiantong Road, Line 10)** (north-west of store)
  - Closest exits on static map: ~**700 m** north-west.
  - Use case: overflow commuter route and alternative access for office workers and residents north of 苏州河.

**Implication for target customers**

- **Young professionals & morning commuters**
  - Line 2 & 10 link key employment and residential corridors (浦东陆家嘴–虹桥机场/火车站, etc.).
  - Morning peak metro riders who surface at 南京东路站 have only **1–3 minutes** extra walk to pass your storefront.

- **Students**
  - Many students commute via Lines 1/2/8/10; those heading to downtown campuses/offices often interchange at 人民广场 or 南京东路.
  - Within **10–12 minutes** walking from either node, the store is on a natural through-route.

### 1.2 Bus network

Within **500–600 m**, there are **>20 bus stops**, including:

- **南京东路步行街东侧 / 南京东路站(公交)**: ~**80–100 m** away.
- **河南中路–天津路 / 河南中路–福州路 / 九江路–江西中路 / 北京东路–河南中路 / 福州中路–南京东路等**:
  - Distances range **80–650 m**.
  - Multiple lines connect:
    - 北向: across 苏州河 to静安/虹口。
    - 南向: 外滩南段、老城厢、陆家浜路方向。
    - 西向: 人民广场–静安寺–中山公园轴线。
    - 东向: 外滩、浦东轮渡接驳点。

**Transit catchment:**
- Realistic **0–5 min walk** from bus to store: radius ~**350–400 m**.
- Most riders alight within this zone; your entrance is then directly along the pedestrianized or semi-pedestrian spine of 南京东路, so **no backtracking detour is required for east–west walkers**.

---

## 2. Parking availability

Within **~900 m** the immediate POI query shows mostly retail/restaurant/office listings; structured parking near this site is largely embedded in:

- **宏伊国际广场 / 恒基名人购物中心 / 百联ZX等大型商业体**
  - All within **0–150 m** of the store.
  - Underground / podium parking typically in this area:
    - Capacity per complex often in the **100–300+ spaces** range.
    - Effective walking distance from a typical basement parking elevator to street level near your frontage: **50–200 m** (1–3 minutes).

- **Bund-area & 外滩金牛广场 parking (overlay W on map)**
  - ~**600–650 m** east.
  - Serves tourists and business guests driving to the Bund; some will walk west along 南京东路, passing by your stretch.

- **Fuzhou Rd / Henan Rd / 延安东路 corridor (south of A, overlay H/B)**
  - Mixture of office and hotel garages:
    - ~**300–700 m** walking distance.

**Implications:**

- Customers who **drive to nearby malls/offices**:
  - Can reach the shop with **3–8 minutes total walk** from parked car, depending on garage.
  - For a boutique coffee shop, the primary customer base will still be **pedestrian & transit-based**, but parking capacity supports:
    - Hotel guests using taxis/private cars.
    - Office workers who occasionally drive.

- On-street parking is highly restricted along 南京东路步行街; **spontaneous “park and grab” coffee demand is low**. Drivers are mostly destination visitors rather than pass-by.

## 3. Customer flow analysis

Using the previous customer analysis and new transit context, we can structure flows by origin and direction.

### 3.1 Metro commuters

- **From 南京东路站 → offices (west/south)**
  - Many commuters exit at 南京东路站 and walk:
    - West along 南京东路 toward 人民广场与周边写字楼。
    - South along 河南中路 / 福建中路 toward 福州路–延安东路办公区。
  - Your location:
    - Sits **~50–100 m west of key exits** and on the **south side of the pedestrian axis**.
    - Any commuter whose office is south or west and who exists to street level at Henan/Nanjing will naturally pass **within 0–2 storefronts’ distance** from your entrance.

- **From 人民广场站 → 南京东路 / 外滩**
  - Tourists or commuters transferring from Lines 1/8:
    - Walk east along 南京东路 for **700–900 m**.
    - Your segment is roughly the **midway / upper-middle point** of this walk.
  - Flow composition in morning:
    - Commuters heading to 南京东路或外滩附近办公楼。
    - Early-start tourists going to the Bund.
  
### 3.2 Office workers

Previous estimate:

- **500 m radius**: ~**12,000 office workers**.
- **1 km radius**: ~**36,000 office workers**.

Main walking vectors:

1. **South–north**
   - From 福州路–延安东路办公带走到南京路步行街吃早餐/买咖啡后再上班。
   - Route: North on 河南中路/福建中路 → cut into 南京东路步行街 **just west or east of your location**.
   - You are **directly on the axis** that these workers traverse when they “go up” to 南京东路 for food and coffee.

2. **West–east**
   - Offices around 人民广场/南京西路区域 → clients/meetings near Bund, or vice versa.
   - They often walk / taxi along 南京路; those who walk the full distance pass your door.

Given **~36,000 office workers within 1 km**, even a modest daily penetration of:
- **1–2%** yields **360–720 potential daily passes** with **very low detour** (see Section 4), primarily during 8:00–11:00 and 13:30–18:00 windows.

### 3.3 Tourists & hotel guests

From prior analysis:

- **1 km radius hotels**: ~**3,000 rooms**, ≈**3,600 guests/night** (assuming 1.2 guests/room).
- ≈**60%** are likely to walk at least once along 南京东路 near the store → **2,100–2,200 tourist pedestrians/day** with natural route overlap.

Flow directions:

- **Bund → 南京东路 → 人民广场**
  - Tourists walking **west** from 外滩:
    - Reach your location after **~600–700 m**, roughly a **10-minute** scenic stroll.
  - Likely beverage/coffee demand:
    - Morning: hotel breakfast done; they look for “nice coffee” on the way to metro/sightseeing.
    - Afternoon: rest point after walking the Bund and part of 南京东路.

- **People’s Square / museums → 南京东路 → Bund**
  - Tourists walking **east** encounter your shop still early in their walk, when they might want a take-away beverage.

### 3.4 Students & young locals

- Student flows are more diffuse, but key patterns:
  - **Language schools / training centers / cram schools** in the vicinity (inside office towers and malls).
  - **大学生 &年轻白领** meeting friends on 南京路/外滩 at evenings & weekends.
- They typically arrive via:
  - **Metro Lines 1/2/8/10**, then walk **5–12 minutes**.
  - **Bus** from other downtown districts.
- The coffee shop’s appeal:
  - **Ambience + seating** is important; many will stay for **1–2 hours** rather than quick in-out.
  - Morning flows include **test-prep and internship commuters**; evening flows are **social & study sessions**.

## 4. Detour estimation & catchment

Below is the static map used:

![Static map](https://restapi.amap.com/v3/staticmap?location=121.484103%2C31.237549&zoom=16&size=512%2A512&markers=mid%2C%2CA%3A121.484103%2C31.237549%7Cmid%2C%2CM%3A121.484628%2C31.238101%7Cmid%2C%2CP%3A121.487%2C31.2395%7Cmid%2C%2CH%3A121.4823%2C31.2338%7Cmid%2C%2CB%3A121.4801%2C31.233%7Cmid%2C%2CW%3A121.4901%2C31.2399&key=68913ce8db83f7bbe5b4cca9720c7a8f&styles=default)

- **A**: Store location (南京东路300号, south side of 南京东路步行街)
- **M**: 南京东路地铁站核心位置 /出口群
- **W**: 外滩–外白渡桥一带
- **H / B**: 福州中路–福建中路–延安东路办公/酒店方向
- **P**: 北侧核心街区 / 车流&客流节点

### 4.1 Detour for key flows

Assume typical walking speed **4.5–5 km/h ≈ 75–83 m/min**.

1. **Metro riders exiting 南京东路站 (M)**
   - Direct path from exits to store (A):
     - Distance: **50–180 m**.
     - Time: **1–3 minutes**.
   - “Detour” vs continuing straight to offices:
     - For **southbound office workers** (to 福州路带):
       - They pass A almost directly; **extra detour ≤50 m (~1 minute)**.
     - For **westbound along 南京路**:
       - From M: they would anyway pass A if starting east of A.
       - From some exits west of A: slight backtrack of **≤80–100 m (~1–1.5 minutes)** if they specifically seek you out.

2. **West–east commuters along 南京东路 (People’s Sq → Bund)**
   - Already on **south sidewalk/pedestrian strip**:
     - Storefront lies directly in their path.
     - Detour: **20–50 m** inward from main flow if shop is slightly recessed into the building (≤1 minute).
   - On **north side**:
     - One crossing + small backtrack:
       - Extra **60–160 m**, or **1–3 minutes** including signal wait.

3. **Tourists walking from Bund (W) to 南京东路 station**
   - Total route: **W → A → M** is roughly **600–700 m + 80 m ≈ 680–780 m**.
   - Without visiting store, typical Bund–metro walk is **~600–700 m**.
   - Added detour:
     - If they were already passing the south side: **≤50 m (~0.5–1 minute)**.
     - If on north side: same as above – **60–160 m (~2–3 minutes)**.

4. **Office workers from south (H/B) coming up for coffee**
   - From 福州中路–福建中路十字路口 (H):
     - To 南京路步行街 is about **250–300 m**; your store is then **around the closest mid-block**.
     - Extra detour versus any other shop along 南京东路:
       - Essentially **0–80 m**, depending on precise desire to choose you vs. alternatives (≤1–1.5 minutes).
   - From 更南部 (延安东路、金陵东路):
     - When they decide “go up to 南京路 for coffee/food”, they usually choose the **Henan Rd / Fujian Rd axis**, which delivers them **within 100–150 m** of A naturally.

### 4.2 5-min and 10-min detour catchment (focusing on target customers)

Use two concepts:

- **Core walking path** (people already passing near A).
- **Detour-radius** (additional time someone is willing to spend off their natural path).

**5-minute detour radius (~350–400 m extra)**

Within an **additional 5 minutes** of walking:

- **Metro riders**
  - All users of 南京东路站 (≈300,000人次/日 estimate) can include your shop with ≤5 extra minutes before/after their trip.
  - Conservatively, **20–30%** are morning and mid-day commuters and students who value coffee:
    - **~60,000–90,000 suitable potential daily riders** have ≤5-min detour friction.

- **Office workers**
  - Within 500 m: ~**12,000 office workers**.
  - Many are **≤5 minutes** away via direct streets, even if their natural path doesn’t already pass you.
  - Potential 5-min detour population among office workers: effectively the **majority of those 12,000**.

- **Residents**
  - 500 m population: **22,669**.
  - For morning commuter use, realistic penetration is lower, but **a large share** can reach you in ≤10 minutes direct walk; many are **≤5 extra minutes** if they already walk toward Ho Nan Rd / metro.

- **Tourists**
  - Guests in Bund & 南京东路 hotels: most hotel clusters are within **600–900 m**.
  - If they are already walking to 南京东路 or metro, your shop fits within **5 extra minutes** at most.

**10-minute detour radius (~700–800 m extra)**

Expands to essentially:

- The whole **人民广场–南京东路–外滩三角区**.
- Encompasses:
  - The **36,000 office workers within 1 km**.
  - The **77,398 residents within 1 km**.
  - Major hotels (~3,000 rooms) plus dense tourist crowd.

**Quantitative implication:**

From previous customer analysis:

- Daily effective potential for a **well-executed boutique coffee shop**:
  - **Realistic actual buyer volume**: **350–450 cups/day** in baseline; **500–650 cups/day** with strong execution.
- In relation to detour:
  - The actual **detour cost** for nearly all these customers is **≤5 minutes**, and often **≤2 minutes**, which supports:
    - Impulse purchases for commuters.
    - Short pre-work meetings.
    - Quick hotel-guest grab-and-go.

## 5. Visibility analysis

### 5.1 Street-level visibility

- Location: **南京东路300号**, within **恒基名人购物中心 / 宏伊国际广场 / Apple Store 南京东路**一带。
- Surrounding POIs (0–70 m):
  - Apple 南京东路、Manner、Costa、瑞幸、霸王茶姬、7分甜、麦当劳、巴黎贝甜等。
- Position relative to traffic:
  - **On the main pedestrian spine of 南京东路步行街**, not in a back alley.
  - The street segment has a **dense cluster of F&B and branded storefronts**, so:
    - **Raw visibility frequency is high** (hundreds of thousands of passersby/day on your 300 m segment).
    - However, **visual competition is intense**; façade quality, signage size, and nighttime lighting are critical.

### 5.2 Mall vs. street placement

- If the store is:
  1. **Directly street-facing**:
     - Visible to practically **all east–west pedestrian flows** on 南侧人行道/步行带.
     - Morning commuters and tourists can notice the shop in **1–2 seconds** of visual scan.
  2. **Inside a mall podium (e.g., 恒基名人购物中心内)**:
     - Visibility then depends on:
       - Ground-floor entrance positioning.
       - Vertical circulation paths (escalator lines from metro corridor to mall).
     - In-mall visibility:
       - You may capture flows heading to food courts and fashion stores.
       - However, **you lose a portion of purely through-flow pedestrians** who stay at street level.

Given the data (Apple Store POI indicating an **in-building but highly visible street-front retail environment**):

- You can assume **high “visual contact” with street pedestrians**, but:
  - Need distinctive **storefront design, recognizable branding, and clear coffee cues** to stand out among multiple coffee/tea options within **50–70 m**.

## 6. Summary: Pros and Cons in terms of traffic

### Pros

- **1. Exceptional transit access**
  - ≤**200 m** from multiple exits of **南京东路地铁站 (Lines 2/10)**.
  - Within **10–12 minutes** walk of **人民广场站 (Lines 1/2/8)**.
  - Dense bus network with **>20 stops within 650 m**; several within **≤200 m**.

- **2. Minimal detour for core targets**
  - Metro commuters and office workers:
    - Typically incur **≤100 m (~1–1.5 minutes)** extra walking to include a stop at the shop.
  - Tourists moving between Bund and People’s Square:
    - On the south side of 南京东路, **practically zero detour**.
  - Overall: **5-minute detour radius (~400 m)** covers tens of thousands of daily potential users (metro + offices + hotels + residents).

- **3. Strong overlap with high-intent flows**
  - The location is on a segment with estimated **~306,000 daily passersby**, including:
    - **76,500 during 7:00–11:00** with **~30,000 in direct visual range**.
  - These flows include:
    - **Office commuters** (high morning coffee propensity).
    - **Tourists** (Bund & hotel guests).
    - **Young professionals & students** commuting through the CBD.

- **4. Suitable for boutique positioning**
  - Target customers (young professionals, students, morning commuters) are **heavily concentrated** in this area.
  - Many are willing to **spend 1–5 extra minutes** for higher-quality coffee and a comfortable environment.

### Cons

- **1. Extreme competition around the node**
  - Within **~60 m**:
    - Multiple coffee and beverage brands (Manner, Costa, 瑞幸, KOI, 霸王茶姬, CoCo, etc.).
  - Result:
    - Need **high differentiation** (ambience, specialty menu, service) to capture a meaningful share.
    - Price sensitivity and brand loyalty can limit conversion from pure passersby.

- **2. High rent and high break-even volume**
  - This traffic node commands **premium rents**.
  - To justify rent, the business must:
    - Sustain **≥350–450 cups/day** baseline and aim for **500–650+ cups/day**.
    - Maintain efficient **morning peak production** (7:00–11:00 potentially 60–65% of daily volume).

- **3. Potential crowding / congestion**
  - Heavy tourism + commuter flows can:
    - Make it **hard for customers to stop and decide** if the frontage is small.
    - Create **queue management challenges** spilling into pedestrian space.

---

### Overall assessment

From a **traffic and accessibility standpoint**, this location is highly favorable for a **boutique coffee shop** targeting:

- **Morning commuters** (metro + office workers).
- **Young professionals & students** (study/social use).
- **Tourists** (Bund and 南京东路 corridor).

Detour costs are universally low (usually **≤2–3 minutes** and often negligible) for the majority of relevant flows, and public transit connectivity is excellent. The primary risk is **competitive density and high operating cost**, not a lack of traffic. To succeed, the store must leverage:

- Strong **street visibility** (façade, signage).
- **Fast, reliable morning operations** for commuters in a rush.
- A distinct **ambience and product quality** to convert high-traffic into loyal, repeat customers despite numerous alternatives nearby.
