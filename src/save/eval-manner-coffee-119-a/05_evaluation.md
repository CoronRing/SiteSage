# Evaluation Scores

## Customer Analysis: 7.6/10
The report demonstrates a very strong underlying customer node but somewhat overstates what is realistically reachable at the storefront corridor. For repeat users, the analysis supports ~2,000 on-site workers plus a large nearby office cluster and commuting residents, but once constrained to people actually passing within ~30–40 m of the lobby frontage and accounting for competition, a conservative estimate is roughly 15–20k repeat passers and about 600–900 deterministic repeat cups/weekday, placing criterion 1 in the strong (not absolute prime) band. In the fixed 3-hour morning window, those same constraints imply perhaps 180–250 deterministic commuter cups, i.e., a solid but not crush-loaded funnel, hence a mid–upper ‘moderate’ score for criterion 2. The report clearly shows heavy hotel and tourist/leisure activity in Xintiandi, with incremental non-repeat demand easily exceeding 100 cups/weekday, which justifies a strong leisure-base score. Micro-placement is good: a lobby on Madang Road beside high-profile tenants suggests a visible position on a key feeder street, though the report itself flags dependence on lobby design and signage, so exposure is rated as good rather than fully dominant. Competition is intense (multiple international and boutique cafés in and around Xintiandi), but node-wide coffee demand is very large, so the site is judged ‘balanced to tight’ rather than oversupplied. Flow stability is excellent: a mature, central CBD-style environment with strong, diversified anchors and a major 3-line metro node, while demographics are almost ideal for premium coffee (high working-age share, affluent white-collar and tourist mix, and existing coffee culture). These factors combine to a high but not top-tier overall score, with the main limiting factor being realistic conversion of large node-wide flows into repeat morning corridor traffic for this specific lobby location.

## Traffic & Accessibility: 5.5/10
Overall traffic and accessibility quality is moderate for a commuter-focused coffee shop, yielding a 5.5/10. The report shows very strong macro density (≈61k working-age residents and 25–35k workers within 1 km), justifying a 7.5 for E, and a solid but not dominant metro link (one nearby high-volume station but only ~8–18k of its 80–120k users pass near the Xintiandi/Madang Rd frontage), which supports a moderate 5.0 for D. Effective morning pass-by right at the storefront is harder to rate; the unit is inside Tiandi Square’s Area A lobby on the edge of Xintiandi rather than on the highest-footfall pedestrian plazas, and visibility may depend on lobby design, so a conservative 5.5 (secondary but meaningful corridor, not the primary flow) is appropriate for A. Detour fit is also mixed: in-building workers have near-zero detour, but most metro→office or metro→home flows outside Tiandi Square require 4–7 extra minutes, putting B at a moderate 6.0. Commuter composition is balanced: significant office and resident commuter bases exist, but the area is also a strong tourist/leisure destination with many flows occurring outside peak commuting hours, so C is reasonably scored at 6.0. Captive on-site population is limited to ~2,000 office workers plus ~500 daily visitors in the same building, yielding ≈2,500 captive users and a 3.5 for F, consistent with the 1,000–2,999 band. In-project visibility is uncertain—potentially good if the lobby opens directly to Madang Rd, but possibly only moderate if the store is set back—so a mid-range 5.5 for G reflects that ambiguity. Parking is clearly strong, with several hundred spaces within a 2–3 minute walk and easy car access, warranting a 6.0 (adequate-to-good) for H. Global caps do not further reduce the weighted average since A, B, C, D are all ≥5 and G ≥4, but F<4 caps the total at ≤7, well above the computed 5.5.

## Competition Analysis: 7.6/10
The analysis clearly positions this Xintiandi/Tiandi Square lobby site as a very high-volume CBD node with strong captive office demand. The report’s own quantified estimates (1,000–1,400 cups/day baseline, up to 1,600–2,300 in an optimized scenario) imply an RSV comfortably above 1,000 cups/day, warranting a high Effective Node Volume score around 9.0 under the rubric’s ≥1,000 cups/day band. At the same time, the competitive environment is shown to be extremely dense: over 30 relevant outlets within 300 m and more than 70 coffee-related venues within roughly 480 m. This falls into the rubric’s poor saturation band (31–45 outlets within 300 m and >50 within 500 m), but the report notes very high absolute demand and does not present clear evidence of widespread weak/empty units, so a mid-range “poor” score of 4.0 is appropriate rather than pushing into the extreme 0–2.9 range. On positioning white space, the analysis identifies a real but execution-dependent niche as the “building coffee hub” with near-zero detour for Tiandi Square tenants and faster commuter service versus nearby Peet’s, Miracle, and mall cafés, yet all major price/format positions (value chains, global brands, premium boutiques, dessert cafés) are already present within 100–300 m. This supports an “adequate” white space score of 6.0. For anchor/incumbent risk, multiple strong brands (Peet’s at 4 m, Peninsula café and Miracle within ~50 m, plus numerous Starbucks/Manner/M Stand/Luckin units at 200–300 m) create significant pressure, but there is no hero Reserve/Roastery or iconic flagship co-located within 0–10 m on the same flow; this fits the rubric’s “adequate” band, and a 5.5 reflects meaningful but not extreme anchor risk. Weighting these dimension scores per the rubric yields a final competition favorability score of 7.6, which reflects a highly trafficked but heavily contested node where success is possible but strongly contingent on capturing the identified lobby and low-detour office demand.
