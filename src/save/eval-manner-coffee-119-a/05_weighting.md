# Weighting Rationale

- **Store type & context**
  - Coffee shop / café in a **first-floor lobby** on Madang Road, Shanghai.
  - Likely to serve a mix of **building occupants (office workers, tenants)** and **street foot traffic** from a busy urban corridor.

- **Customer (0.31)**
  - Coffee has **broad demographic appeal**, so hyper-specific targeting is less critical than for a niche boutique.
  - Still important to understand:
    - Density of office workers and nearby residents.
    - Income levels and spending power for premium vs. value positioning.
    - Typical visit patterns (morning commute, lunch break, afternoon break).
  - This supports a **moderate** customer weight within the coffee shop guideline range.

- **Traffic & Accessibility (0.39)**
  - Lobby location means the business will **live or die by daily foot traffic** and ease of access.
  - Key drivers:
    - Volume of people entering/exiting the building.
    - Visibility from Madang Road and ease of walk-in from the street.
    - Convenience for quick grab-and-go during commute or breaks.
  - As a coffee shop in a dense urban area, this justifies a **high traffic weight** near the top of the recommended range.

- **Competition (0.30)**
  - Central Shanghai typically has **many coffee options** (chains, independents, convenience formats).
  - Competition matters for:
    - Price positioning and product mix.
    - Differentiation via quality, speed, ambiance, or brand.
  - However, even in a competitive market, a **strong, convenient lobby location** can capture a captive audience, so competition is important but slightly less weighted than traffic.

- **Overall balance**
  - Weights align with coffee shop guidelines:
    - Customer: within 0.30–0.33 range.
    - Traffic: within 0.35–0.40 range and set highest.
    - Competition: within 0.30–0.35 range.
  - Reflects a model where **high daily footfall and convenience** are primary, with **demographic fit and competitive positioning** as important but secondary factors.
