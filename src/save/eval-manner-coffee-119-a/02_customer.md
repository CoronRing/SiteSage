## 4. Xintiandi & 119 Madang Road Footfall Context

While precise daily foot traffic numbers for 119 Madang Rd itself are not published, we can triangulate:

- Xintiandi is described in multiple travel and commercial sources as a **top destination for dining and nightlife**, with:
  - Several shopping centers and bar streets.
  - Heavy tourist presence, especially evenings/weekends and holidays.
- Comparable flagship lifestyle precincts in central Shanghai (Xintiandi, Taikoo Li Qiantan, Nanjing East Rd area) often report:
  - **Peak weekend daily visitors** in the **80,000–150,000 range** to the broader precinct.
  - **Weekday daily visitors** often in the **40,000–80,000 range**.

Your site is at:

- A **building lobby** (Tiandi Square) on Madang Rd, which is one of the main pedestrian spines feeding into Xintiandi from the south.
- Next to flagship stores like **DJI | Hasselblad Shanghai Xintiandi Store** at 119 Madang Rd, indicating **high‑profile street visibility** and deliberate selection for strong footfall.

## 5. Main Customer Sources

### 5.1 On‑site & Same‑Building Population (Tiandi Square, 119 Madang Rd)

- Mixed‑use: offices + flagship retail + lobby visitors.
- A typical Grade‑A inner‑ring office/commercial building of this footprint in Shanghai might host:
  - **1,500–3,000 office workers**.
  - Additional **visitors/clients**: ~300–800/day.
- **Conservative assumption** for your building:
  - **2,000 regular workers**
  - **500 daily external visitors**

Potential coffee‑shop users from same building:

- If **20–30%** of workers buy coffee or beverages **once per weekday**:
  - 2,000 × 25% = **500 weekday purchases**.
- Plus **5–10% of visitors**: 500 × 7% ≈ **35 purchases**.
- **Deterministic on‑site weekday potential:** about **400–600 cups/day** if product/positioning is competitive.

### 5.2 Nearby Office Population (within 500 m)

- Estimated **office workers within 500 m**: 25,000–35,000.
- Only a share of them pass close enough or are willing to walk to your lobby:
  - Assume **15%** have walking‑distance access/habit for this side of Xintiandi → **3,750–5,250 workers** in effective catchment.
  - If **10–20%** of those purchase once per weekday:
    - 3,750 × 12% ≈ **450**
    - 5,250 × 15% ≈ **788**
  - **Likely office‑worker demand beyond same building:** **~400–800 cups/weekday**.

### 5.3 Hotel Guests & Tourists

From nearby hotels and attractions:

- **Hotel guests staying within 400 m:** ~2,000 per night.
- If **20–30%** buy coffee outside hotel at least once daily:
  - 2,000 × 25% = **500 potential daily buyers** in the micro‑area.
- But they distribute across many cafés in Xintiandi; you capture only a share:
  - Assume **10–20% market share** within that coffee pool:
    - 500 × 10% = **50**
    - 500 × 20% = **100**
  - **Hotel‑guest coffee potential for your shop:** **~50–100 cups/day**.

Additional **walking tourists** (non‑hotel):

- Xintiandi daily visitors estimated: weekday 40,000–80,000, weekend 80,000–150,000 across whole precinct.
- Your frontage is not at the absolute core pedestrian plaza, but at a key feeder street:
  - Assume **5–10% of precinct visitors** pass within **70–100 m** of your lobby:
    - Weekday: 2,000–8,000 passers‑by
    - Weekend: 4,000–15,000 passers‑by
- If **0.5–1.0%** of those passing close are converted:
  - Weekday: 2,000–8,000 × 0.7% ≈ **14–56 cups/day**
  - Weekend: 4,000–15,000 × 0.7% ≈ **28–105 cups/day**

### 5.4 Local Residents (≤ 500 m)

- **Residents within 500 m:** 23,872; working‑age ~15,715.
- However, many may already commute away during the day; they are important for:
  - Morning takeaway (before work)
  - Evening and weekend leisure coffee
- Realistic effective capture:
  - Assume **10–15%** of residents ever become **at least occasional** customers: 2,400–3,600 people.
  - On an average weekday, maybe **5–8%** of these regulars buy:
    - 2,400 × 6% = **144**
    - 3,600 × 6% = **216**
  - **Resident‑driven daily demand:** **~100–200 cups on weekdays**, potentially higher on weekends.

### 5.5 Metro Footfall

- Station usage: **80,000–120,000 trips/day** (entries + exits).
- Portion that routes near your building:
  - Many exits point towards Xintiandi – your street is one of several main paths.
  - Assume **10–15%** of station users come through the Madang Rd/Xintiandi frontage in your block: 8,000–18,000 people.
- Coffee conversion:
  - If **0.3–0.7%** of those purchase near your lobby:
    - 8,000 × 0.5% = **40**
    - 18,000 × 0.5% = **90**
  - Some overlap with tourists and office workers already counted; **incremental** unique metro‑driven sales: **20–50 cups/day**.

## 6. Customer Number Estimation

### 6.1 Deterministic / Conservative Daily Volume

Focus on **weekday averages** during normal business periods (non‑holiday), assuming competent but not dominant coffee brand, modest marketing, and current competition level.

Estimated from main segments:

- Same‑building workers & visitors: **400–600 cups/day**
- Nearby office workers (beyond same building): **400–800 cups/day**
- Hotel guests: **50–100 cups/day**
- Local residents: **100–200 cups/day**
- Tourists & metro incremental (not double‑counted with above): **50–100 cups/day**

Add conservatively, while allowing for overlap (e.g., some “tourists” are also metro users or hotel guests):

- Lower bound: 400 + 400 + 50 + 100 + 50 = **1,000 cups/day**
- Upper conservative bound (with overlap deduction): ~600 + 800 + 100 + 200 + 100 ≈ 1,800, minus ~20% overlap ≈ **1,400–1,500 cups/day**

**Deterministic operating range (once stabilized):**

- **Weekday:** about **1,000–1,400 cups/day**  
- **Weekend:** higher tourist/resident share; reasonable to project **1,100–1,600 cups/day** assuming similar conversion ratios, as office worker traffic softens but tourist and leisure traffic rises.

If your coffee shop is small/medium (capacity ~300–600 cups/day), the **building and immediate office base alone** can fill capacity, with tourist and resident business as upside.

### 6.2 Potential / Maximum Scenario

Assume:

- Strong brand & product.
- Effective visibility from street & building lobby.
- Competitive pricing for white‑collar segment.
- Optimized speed and digital ordering (delivery + pickup).

Then:

- Same‑building capture could reach **30–35%** of workers daily at peak:
  - 2,000 workers → 600–700 cups.
- Wider office capture **20–25% of effective office catchment**:
  - 4,000–5,000 workers → 800–1,250 cups.
- Residents + tourists + hotel + metro could add **300–600 cups**.

Potential **upper‑bound** sustainable daily volume:

- **~1,600–2,300 cups/day** on strong weekdays.
- Peak **weekend or holiday days** (Golden Week, etc.) could temporarily exceed **2,500 cups/day**, but those peaks are not year‑round.

  - An estimated **80,000–120,000 station trips/day**, a portion of which feed your block.
- **Income profile:**
  - Xintiandi is known as home to **elites and executive expats**; high willingness to pay for premium coffee and specialty drinks.

### 7.2 Cons / Risks

- **High competition:**
  - Xintiandi and nearby malls are already filled with:
    - International chains (e.g., Starbucks, Costa, %Arabica, etc.), local boutique cafés, and dessert shops.
  - Capturing and maintaining **10–20% share** of local coffee demand requires clear differentiation and strong execution.
- **High rent and operating costs:**
  - Central Xintiandi rent levels are among the highest in Shanghai.
  - Profitability relies on achieving **medium‑to‑high volumes (≥800–1,000 cups/day)** or strong average ticket (e.g., food + coffee).
- **Footfall variability:**
  - Office‑driven segment is strong on weekdays, weaker on weekends.
  - Tourist flow is seasonal and weather‑dependent; heavy reliance on this segment introduces volatility.
- **Competition for attention inside building lobby:**
  - If lobby design or signage does not clearly expose your shop to street traffic, relying solely on internal office footfall could cap growth.
  - Need to ensure **visibility from Madang Road** and possibly **collaboration with building management** (signage, wayfinding).
