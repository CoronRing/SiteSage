## Public transit availability

**Metro**

Within 800 m of the store (A: 31.22074, 121.474312):

- **一大会址·黄陂南路 Station (Lines 1/10/14)**
  - Main station POI: ~374 m north‑northwest of the store.
  - Nearest exits to the store:
    - Exit cluster at ~31.2226, 121.4737: distance **216–236 m** from the store.
    - Other exits (2/3/6/7, etc.) within **220–460 m**.
  - Effective walking time from closest exit to store:
    - 216–250 m at ~83 m/min ≈ **3–4 minutes**.
  - Customer analysis (given): **80,000–120,000 passenger trips/day**, with **8,000–18,000/day** estimated to pass near the Madang Rd/Xintiandi frontage.

- **一大会址·新天地 Station (same station group / alternate naming for Line 10/13 section)**
  - Exits labeled as “新天地” around 31.2163–31.2169, 121.4747–121.4761.
  - Distances from store: **440–560 m**.
  - Walking time: **5–7 minutes**.

- Other stations at the fringe of 800 m:
  - 老西门 station exits and 大世界 exits around 780–800 m away.
  - Walking time: **9–11 minutes** – marginal for regular coffee use, more relevant for occasional pass‑throughs.

**Bus**

- The Amap category query is dominated by metro exits, but this corridor (马当路 / 淮海中路 / 兴安路) typically carries multiple bus lines.
- Conservatively, within 400–500 m:
  - Expect **3–6 bus lines** on 淮海中路 and surrounding arteries, feeding flow into Xintiandi.
  - These lines mainly reinforce metro‑fed, walk‑in traffic rather than define a separate commuting node right at the store.

**Conclusion on transit**

- The store is within **3–4 minutes** of the nearest metro exit and **<7 minutes** of multiple others.
- Combined with the given station throughput, there is a **direct addressable pool of ~8,000–18,000 daily metro users** passing near the Xintiandi/Madang Rd frontage, of which a share is within quick walking detour distance to the store.

## Customer flow analysis

Using the previous customer analysis as the base:

### 1. Key customer pools

Within 500–1,000 m:

- **Residents**
  - 300 m: **8,918** residents.
  - 500 m: **23,872** residents.
  - 1,000 m: **93,682** residents.
  - Working‑age (15–59 yrs, 65–68%):
    - 500 m: ≈ **15,715**.
    - 1,000 m: ≈ **61,314**.

- **Office workers**
  - 8–12 sizable office buildings within 500 m.
  - Estimated **25,000–35,000 office workers** within 500 m.
  - ~2,000 in Tiandi Square itself; ~500 daily external visitors to the building.

- **Hotels**
  - ~1,300–1,500 rooms within ~400 m; ~2,000 guests/night on average.
  - Includes Langham, Andaz, Ascott and other Xintiandi hotels.

- **Tourists / leisure visitors**
  - Attractions: 中共一大会址纪念馆, 新天地步行街, 太平桥公园, K11, Hong Kong Plaza, etc.
  - Overlaps heavily with metro and bus flows; many visitors walk between Huangpi South Rd Station, Xintiandi, and the surrounding malls.

### 2. Main movement patterns

- **Metro → Xintiandi / offices / malls**
  - Origin: 一大会址·黄陂南路 station exits (~220–450 m).
  - Flows:
    - North / northeast: toward K11, Hong Kong Plaza, Nanjing Rd fringe.
    - East: into 新天地北里 and hotel cluster.
    - South / southwest: toward Xintiandi South Block, Tiandi Square, and office towers around 太仓路、兴安路、建国中路.
  - The store is in **Tiandi Square’s Area A lobby**, on the **east edge of Xintiandi**, so it intercepts:
    - Office workers entering/leaving Tiandi Square (~2,000 internal staff + visitors).
    - A share of **southbound Xintiandi visitors** who walk down Madang Rd.

- **Residents → Metro / Xintiandi / offices**
  - West and south of Madang Rd: dense residential blocks.
  - Morning:
    - Home → Metro / offices: flows may pass **near but not necessarily through** the lobby, depending on building gates.
  - Evening:
    - Metro / offices → Home: higher openness to coffee/dessert detour.

- **Hotels / tourists**
  - Tourists and business travelers going:
    - Hotel ↔ Xintiandi, museums, shopping malls.
    - Many paths are **tangential** to the store: the main “tourist spine” runs along Madang Rd and within the Xintiandi pedestrian street network.
  - The lobby store is well‑positioned for:
    - Guests of Langham / Andaz walking toward the metro or K11.
    - Visitors who cut through or around Tiandi Square.

### 3. In‑building vs. street‑level flow

- Being on the **first‑floor lobby of Tiandi Square Area A**:
  - High penetration among:
    - Tenants and visitors of Tiandi Square.
    - People using the building as a sheltered shortcut between Madang Rd and rear streets.
  - Among the **25,000–35,000 office workers** in a 500 m radius, roughly:
    - **2,000–3,000** are “captive” (same building / same property).
    - **5,000–10,000** are in adjacent towers with 2–6 minute walking detours.

## Detour estimation and catchment

Below is the static map generated for this analysis:

- **A**: Store (Tiandi Square, 119 Madang Rd)
- **M**: Representative metro exit for 一大会址·黄陂南路
- **O**: Representative nearby office cluster southwest of the metro
- **R**: Residential cluster southeast (park‑adjacent housing)

Static map URL (Amap):
- https://restapi.amap.com/v3/staticmap?location=121.474312%2C31.22074&zoom=16&size=512%2A512&markers=mid%2C%2CA%3A121.474312%2C31.22074%7Cmid%2C%2CM%3A121.4763%2C31.2223%7Cmid%2C%2CO%3A121.4725%2C31.2199%7Cmid%2C%2CR%3A121.4768%2C31.2188&key=68913ce8db83f7bbe5b4cca9720c7a8f

Walking speed assumption: **5 km/h ≈ 83 m/min**.

### 1. Detour from metro to store (A)

- Nearest exit cluster: **216–250 m**.
- Direct walking distance metro exit → store: ~**250–300 m** by actual sidewalk.
- Walking time: **3–4 minutes**.
- This is within a **5‑minute primary capture radius** for metro users willing to add a small coffee stop to their journey.

### 2. Metro (M) → Office (O) → Store (A)

From the static map analysis:

- Approximate distances:
  - M → O: **500–600 m**.
  - O → A: **400–500 m**.
  - Direct M → A: **550–650 m**.
- Total metro → office → store route vs direct metro → store:

  - Direct M → A:
    - 550–650 m → **7–8 minutes**.
  - Via O first (M → O → A):
    - 900–1,100 m → **11–13 minutes**.
  - Extra detour for visiting A **after passing through O**:
    - ≈ 350–550 m → **4–7 extra minutes**.

Interpretation:

- **Office workers whose natural path is M → O**:
  - If they want coffee on the way to work, they must **divert off the direct M–O line** by ~4–7 minutes round‑trip.
  - More realistic is: **O → A → O** for breaks; this is a **400–500 m** round trip ≈ **5–7 minutes**, which is acceptable for a quick coffee run.

### 3. Metro (M) → Residential (R) → Store (A)

From the static map analysis:

- Distances:
  - M → R: **700–850 m**.
  - R → A: **400–500 m**.
  - Direct M → A: **550–650 m**.
- Via R path:
  - M → R → A: 1,100–1,350 m → **13–16 minutes**.
  - Extra detour vs direct M → A:
    - 500–750 m → **6–9 extra minutes**.

Interpretation:

- For **commuters heading between Metro and these residential blocks**, the store is a **noticeable detour** if they first go home then walk back.
- Realistic use cases:
  - After work: Metro → A → home, where A is on or near a side of the walking triangle.
  - Expect higher conversion from **residents already passing through Xintiandi / Madang Rd** than from those who go strictly point‑to‑point home.

### 4. 5‑minute and 10‑minute detour ranges

At 83 m/min:

- **5‑minute walking radius** ≈ 415 m.
- **10‑minute walking radius** ≈ 830 m.

Using earlier population and worker estimates and restricting to customers for whom the store is a **detour from an existing route**, not just radial distance:

**Within ~5‑minute detour range**

- Office workers:
  - Tiandi Square tenants and adjacent towers that can reach the store within a 400–450 m detour:
    - Estimated **8,000–12,000 office workers**.
- Residents:
  - Those whose home or daily paths cross within ~400 m of the store (Madang Rd / Tai Cang Rd / 兴安路 belt):
    - Roughly **5,000–8,000 residents**.
- Metro users:
  - Out of **8,000–18,000** daily metro users passing near Madang/Xintiandi frontage, assume:
    - 30–50% within a **≤5‑minute** extra walk to include the store:
    - ≈ **2,400–9,000 people/day** in practical 5‑min detour catchment.

**Within ~10‑minute detour range**

- Office workers:
  - Extending to all major office towers around K11, Hong Kong Plaza, Central Plaza, and Nine Square:
    - **25,000–35,000 workers** potentially able to reach the store with a ≤10‑minute round‑trip detour.
- Residents:
  - Most of the **23,872 residents within 500 m** and a sizable part of **93,682 within 1,000 m** can include the shop in a ≤10‑minute detour to metro/shops:
    - Conservatively **20,000–40,000 residents**.
- Metro users:
  - Within 10‑minute detour, nearly all **8,000–18,000** people passing the Madang/Xintiandi frontage could reach the store.

## Visibility analysis

### Street‑level and building context

- The store is in **Tiandi Square, first‑floor lobby, Area A**, at **119 Madang Rd**.
- Madang Rd itself is a **key north–south spine** of the Xintiandi area:
  - Connects directly to the **Xintiandi pedestrian district** and to **Huangpi South Rd / Middle Huaihai Rd**.
  - Carries significant foot and vehicle traffic between:
    - Metro exits.
    - Xintiandi North Block and South Block.
    - Hotels, offices, and residential complexes.

### Is the store on the main flow?

- The **primary tourist and leisure flow**:
  - Runs along the **Xintiandi pedestrian streets** and the **east side of Madang Rd**.
  - These flows are dense around the F&B corridors and plazas.
- Tiandi Square lobby (Area A):
  - If the lobby opens directly to Madang Rd with clear storefront glazing and signage, the store will:
    - Be visible to people walking along Madang Rd on the **east edge of Xintiandi**.
    - Capture the **intersection of building entry flow and street flow**.
  - If the shop is deeper inside the lobby, away from glass lines:
    - Visibility from the main pedestrian street will depend heavily on:
      - Exterior signage.
      - Standee / directional signs at the building entrance.

### Intersection and corner effects

- The store is **just off the core tourist intersections**:
  - Not at the absolute highest‑footfall corners within Xintiandi (e.g., central plazas).
  - Instead, it sits at a **transition zone** between:
    - Premium office/hotel zone.
    - Restaurant/bar corridors.
- This position favors:
  - Office worker and hotel guest visibility.
  - Slightly less top‑of‑mind visibility compared to brands directly fronting the main pedestrian plazas.

## Summary: Pros and Cons in traffic terms

### Pros

- **Strong public transit access**
  - Nearest metro exits within **216–250 m (3–4 min)**.
  - Part of the catchment of a station handling **80,000–120,000 trips/day**, with **8,000–18,000 daily flows** near the Xintiandi/Madang Rd frontage.
- **Excellent parking support**
  - Multiple public and private garages within **100–200 m**, plus on‑street parking.
  - Car‑borne guests can typically access the store from parking in **≤3 minutes** on foot.
- **Dense and diverse demand base**
  - Within 1,000 m:
    - **93,682 residents** (≈61,000 working age).
    - **25,000–35,000 office workers** (8,000–12,000 within a 5‑min detour band).
    - ~**2,000 hotel guests/night**.
  - The store is positioned to serve **workday commuter**, **business traveler**, and **tourist/leisure** segments.
- **Short detours from key flows**
  - For metro users:
    - Direct exit → store: **3–4 minutes**.
    - Many can integrate the shop within a **≤5‑minute** extra detour.
  - For nearby offices:
    - Round‑trip detour from desk to store and back: **5–7 minutes** for Tiandi Square and closest towers.
- **In‑building captive audience**
  - Tiandi Square itself: ~**2,000 employees** + **~500 daily visitors**.
  - These users have **near‑zero detour cost** (1–2 minutes from elevators).

### Cons

- **Not exactly on the straight line of all major flows**
  - For commuters whose natural path is **Metro → more distant offices or residential clusters**, visiting the store adds:
    - **4–7 extra minutes** (office commuters through O).
    - **6–9 extra minutes** (residents in R‑type clusters).
  - This detour cost may limit habitual, twice‑daily usage from more distant buildings.
- **Visibility depends on lobby design**
  - If the shopfront is set back from Madang Rd and not directly facing the main pedestrian flows, it may:
    - Capture building traffic well but rely more on brand recognition and directional signage for street traffic.
- **High competition and “coffee saturation”**
  - In a zone with many **existing cafés and international coffee chains**, a portion of the available traffic is already committed.
  - To reach the **1,000–1,400 cups/day** baseline potential indicated in the previous analysis, the shop must:
    - Convert a substantial share of the **in‑building and immediate‑office** demand.
    - Actively attract metro and tourist flows with strong visibility and differentiation.

---

### Overall traffic assessment

- The site offers **quantitatively strong transit and parking access**, with:
  - A **3–4‑minute** walk from the nearest metro exit.
  - Several hundred parking spaces within **<3 minutes** walk.
- It sits within one of Shanghai’s **densest mixed‑use micro‑markets**, with:
  - **Tens of thousands** of office workers and residents.
  - **Thousands of daily tourists and hotel guests.**
- For target customers from the prior analysis (office workers, residents, hotel guests, tourists), the **5‑minute detour catchment** includes at least:
  - **8,000–12,000 office workers**, **5,000–8,000 residents**, and **2,400–9,000 metro users/day**.
- Traffic quality is therefore high enough to support a **high‑volume coffee operation**, provided:
  - The store achieves **good lobby and street‑level visibility**, and
  - It captures a strong share of in‑building and immediate‑vicinity flows to offset competition and rent.
