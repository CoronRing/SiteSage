# Weighting Rationale

For a boutique coffee shop in Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport's busy terminal, the business model focuses on providing a cozy and inviting atmosphere for young professionals and students. This setup emphasizes traffic and accessibility, as the strategic airport location is crucial for attracting passing travelers, leading to a higher weight on traffic (0.40). The targeted demographic of young professionals and students, combined with a moderate price point, necessitates a solid understanding of the customer profile, reflected in a weight of 0.33. Although competition in an airport setting is relatively contained due to limited storefronts, it's still necessary to differentiate through service and ambiance, thus receiving a slightly lower weight (0.27). This distribution aligns with the business's goals of serving a specific customer base while capitalizing on the high foot traffic the airport offers.
