# Customer Analysis

## Population Overview

- Within a **300-meter radius** of the location, the total population is approximately **1,358** individuals. This area includes transient populations which may directly relate to its position within an airport environment.
  
- Expanding to a **500-meter radius**, the population reaches around **3,362**, indicating a significant increase as expected given the proximity to bustling airport facilities which can draw more potential customers.

- A larger area within a **1,000-meter radius** encompasses a total population of approximately **11,959**, showing a dense urban environment likely inclusive of both residential and commercial zones.

- The **1,500-meter radius** assessment reveals a total population nearing **25,945**, indicating a substantial urban catchment with potential high foot traffic driven by the airport's central role.

## Age Demographics

- In the **300-meter radius**, the largest demographic (74.6% of the population) falls within the **15 to 59 age range**, crucially aligning with the boutique coffee shop's target segments of **young professionals and students**.

- Within the **500-meter radius**, the pattern remains similar, with **71.2%** within the **15 to 59 age bracket**, further affirming the strong presence of the target demographic.

- At the **1,000-meter level**, the **15 to 59 age segment** constitutes about **71%**, and at **1,500 meters**, approximately **73%** falls within this key age group.

This indicates a consistent prevalence of the target customer age group in each radius, ensuring a potentially strong customer base.

## Customer Potential Assessment

Given its strategic location within the Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport and significant population densities at each radius level, this location presents a robust opportunity for the coffee shop. The consistent prevalence of young professionals and students, who are the primary target customers, is promising for penetrating the desired market.

The relatively dense urban setting suggests high foot traffic potential, amplified by the airport's environment, which attracts both a stationary work population and transient travelers likely to be coffee purchasers.

## Data Quality & Limitations

The data is derived from WorldPop, using the GCJ-02 coordinate system. Given its context within an airport, population estimates might fluctuate with transient visitors not consistently captured in permanent residence data. Hence, while indicative of potential, these figures are not solely reflective of constant local residents but should also account for varied daily visits.
