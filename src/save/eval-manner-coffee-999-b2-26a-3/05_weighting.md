# Weighting Rationale

- **Store type & context**
  - Coffee shop / café in the B2 level of Raffles City North Bund, a commercial complex.
  - Near Tilanqiao Metro Station Exit 3, implying strong potential commuter and internal mall traffic.
  - Basement location reduces natural street visibility, increasing dependence on internal flows and wayfinding.

- **Customer (0.31)**
  - Coffee appeals to a broad demographic; not an ultra-niche concept.
  - Key segments likely include office workers in the complex/nearby offices, mall visitors, metro commuters, and local residents.
  - Demographics and usage patterns (workday vs weekend, morning vs afternoon peaks, spending power) matter, but the concept is not so specialized that ultra-precise demographic matching is the primary driver.
  - Therefore, a **moderate customer weight** within the coffee shop guideline range.

- **Traffic & Accessibility (0.39)**
  - Coffee shops are highly dependent on convenience, repeat visits, and impulse/ritual purchases.
  - Proximity to a metro exit and being inside a major commercial complex make **foot traffic and internal accessibility** critical.
  - Basement (B2) location means success hinges on:
    - Direct flows from metro exit into the mall.
    - Visibility along main pedestrian corridors.
    - Ease of access for quick grab-and-go visits.
  - This justifies placing traffic/accessibility at the **top of the weighting range for coffee shops**.

- **Competition (0.30)**
  - Shanghai’s urban coffee market is typically competitive, especially in large malls and near transit.
  - Customers can easily switch between chains and independents; price and convenience are important.
  - However, within a single complex, differentiation via brand, quality, ambiance, and promotions can still attract a loyal subset of daily users.
  - Thus, competition is **important but slightly secondary** to securing strong traffic and matching daily flow patterns, leading to a moderate weight at the lower end of the typical coffee shop competition range.

- **Overall balance**
  - Weights sum to 1.0 and align with coffee shop guidelines:
    - Customer: moderate (0.31) – broad but somewhat defined user base.
    - Traffic: highest (0.39) – critical due to commuter focus and basement location.
    - Competition: moderate (0.30) – competitive environment but not the sole determinant of success.
