The planned store is a coffee shop located inside **北外滩来福士广场 (Raffles City North Bund)** at **上海市虹口区东大名路999号 B2层26A号**, near **提篮桥站 3号口** in Shanghai. Geocoding places it on the lower levels of a large mixed‑use commercial complex in the North Bund area.

On the static map (marker A), the mall sits within the **North Bund commercial and office district**:
- To the **north**, across local streets, there are residential blocks and transit links, giving access to nearby neighborhoods.
- To the **south**, along 东大名路 and 临江大道, there are multiple office and commercial buildings, indicating strong white‑collar daytime crowds.
- To the **east and west**, additional business towers and residential compounds cluster closely around the complex, all within a short walking distance.

This means the coffee shop location is embedded in a **high‑footfall shopping mall**, drawing office workers, local residents, and visitors moving between the riverside North Bund area and nearby transit.
