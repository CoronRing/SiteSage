# Evaluation Scores

## Customer Analysis: 6.9/10
The report supports a solid but not extreme customer potential. On repeat users, deterministic cups for the store from office workers, residents, and schools sum to roughly 270/day, with an additional repeat component inside the 195/day mall/metro segment, putting total repeat cups in the 270–370/day range and repeat passers plausibly in the 6,000–12,000/day band. This fits the 5.0–7.4 rubric band and, given the Grade A CBD office context and strong white-collar share, justifies a 7.0 for Criterion 1. For the 3‑hour morning window, only a fraction of these repeat users will buy (likely around 100–150 cups), and the B2 placement means flows are strong but somewhat diffused versus true station‑throat or streetfront funnels, placing the site in the 5.0–7.4 band at 6.5 for Criterion 2. Leisure and irregular volume is meaningful: mall/metro transients (~195/day to this store) and hotel/tourist users (~10/day) yield around 100+ incremental non‑repeat cups, right at the top of the 30–100 cup “moderate leisure” band, so 7.4 is appropriate for Criterion 3. The micro‑placement on B2, near the metro but not guaranteed to be on the core spine, and the report’s own estimate that only ~15–30% of total mall traffic passes the corridor, imply 10–25% of relevant flows naturally pass the door, matching “moderate exposure” and supporting a 6.5 for Criterion 4. On competition, the analysis assumes 4–8 coffee operators sharing a node‑wide deterministic coffee demand well above 1,500 cups/day (from offices and mall visitors alone), allowing a new store to target ~15% share or more; this fits a “balanced” node and merits 8.0 for Criterion 5. The underlying node—North Bund CBD, Grade A offices atop a new Raffles City mall, metro integration, and dense surrounding residences—suggests high long‑term stability with some office‑dependence but no major structural risk identified, so 8.8 fits the “stable with upside” description for Criterion 6. Finally, demographics and price‑fit are very strong: the catchment is dominated by working‑age office staff, urban residents, students, and hotel business travelers in a high‑end mixed‑use complex where coffee culture is already normal, matching the ≥60% target‑segment threshold and justifying 9.5 for Criterion 7. Combined, these yield a weighted overall score of 6.9 after applying rubric weights and checking global caps.

## Traffic & Accessibility: 6.5/10
The location benefits from strong structural drivers but is held back by uncertain, likely moderate, true storefront pass-by in the key 07:00–10:00 window. The report estimates 8,000–20,000 daily passers-by near the B2 unit but does not break out morning hours or confirm that the storefront sits on the single heaviest corridor, so using the rubric’s conservative rule this maps to an A score around 4.5 (roughly 3,000–6,000 morning passers; side/secondary relative to the absolute main flows). In contrast, path fit for core commuters (B=9.0) is excellent: metro–office and resident–metro flows can include the store with ≤1–3 minutes extra, often directly on their default route through the metro-linked B2 level. The area is clearly commuter-driven on weekdays (C=9.0), with strong AM/PM peaks from a CBD plus dense residential base, so a large share of flows are repeat commuters rather than tourists. Macro transit relevance (D=6.0) is moderate: a single but well-integrated Line 12 station plus heavy buses likely yields relevant volumes in the 30,000–80,000/day range, but not at multi-line hub scale. Surrounding density (E=6.0) is solid urban—about 68,000 residents within 1 km plus at least 15,000–20,000 workers—putting the combined base near the top of the 40,000–89,999 band. Captive in-complex population (F=8.0) is a major strength, with ≈10,000 in-tower office workers directly linked to the podium and using the same B2 transit connection. In-project visibility (G=6.0) is scored as only moderate because the shop is on B2 (no street visibility) and exact placement relative to the main spine is uncertain, even though the analysis suggests it is likely near a primary corridor. Car access and parking (H=9.0) are excellent, with multiple connected garages and low-thousand capacity plus easy drop-off on a major arterial. Combining these with the rubric weights yields a raw score of about 6.5/10, which is within the cap imposed by the moderate A score; overall this is a good commuter-oriented site whose main risk is not traffic potential but actual realized morning pass-by right at the storefront and dependence on internal mall routing.

## Competition Analysis: 6.1/10
The report implies a realistic sustainable volume in the mid-case of about 475 cups/day, with upside to 900–1,000 cups/day under strong execution. Using the rubric’s bands, this places the node firmly in the 450–599 “upper-adequate” RSV range, warranting an Effective Node Volume score of 6.5 given strong B2 flows (8,000–20,000 daily passers) and a large reachable base (>60,000 people). Saturation is clearly high but not extreme: there are roughly 9 coffee-forward outlets within 300 m plus several bakery/tea competitors, and about 25–30 coffee-centric venues within 1 km, with an estimated ~5 coffee outlets per 10,000 people. That aligns with the rubric’s “Adequate” saturation band where 19–30 outlets within 300 m and ~2.6–3.5 per 10k are tolerable in a very strong node, supporting a 6.0 score. Positioning white space is present but narrow and heavily execution-dependent: Manner, Luckin, Starbucks Reserve, M Stand, LUNEURS, and Butterful together cover value commuter, mass specialty, global brand, design café, and bakery formats on the same node. The analysis identifies plausible but not guaranteed niches (fast high-quality commuter, third-place/co-working, and higher-end specialty), consistent with modest incremental uplift and an “Adequate” 6.0 score. Anchor/incumbent risk is high: a Manner unit is effectively co-located (0 m), Peet’s is 10 m away (even if temporarily closed), Butterful and LUNEURS are within ~30 m, and a Starbucks Reserve is only ~49 m away, with Luckin and M Stand within ~150 m. This cluster of multiple top-tier chains and a near-hero Reserve unit on the same mall node fits the rubric’s “Poor” range, justifying a 4.0. Weighting these by the rubric (65/15/10/10) yields an overall competition & node potential score of 6.1, indicating a numerically viable but highly contested node where only a clearly differentiated, well-executed concept is likely to perform sustainably above average.
