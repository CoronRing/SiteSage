Below is a focused traffic report for the coffee shop at **B2‑26A, Raffles City North Bund, 999 Dongdaming Rd (东大名路999号)**.

---

## 1. Public transit availability

### 1.1 Metro

Main station: **Tilanqiao Station (提篮桥站), Line 12**

Nearby metro exits around the mall (straight‑line distance from the shop’s building footprint):

- **Tilanqiao Metro Station entrances/exits**
  - Generic station point: **~125 m** from the mall center  
  - Exit group near Exit 2/3: **~96–140 m** from the mall
  - Exit 1: **~193 m**
  - Exit 4: **~193 m**

Practical walking:

- Metro exit → mall entrance: about **100–150 m**, **1.5–2 minutes** walking.
- Metro concourse → B2 coffee shop inside: add **2–4 minutes** (escalator + indoor navigation).
- Total **metro to shop travel time: ~4–6 minutes** under normal conditions.

Given the previous customer analysis:
- Line 12 Tilanqiao is directly connected to the mall; **B2 captures ~15–30% of mall traffic**, estimated **8,000–20,000 metro‑linked passers‑by/day** passing near the B2 corridor.

### 1.2 Buses

Nearest bus stops (distance from mall):

- **东大名路海门路 (Dongdaming Rd & Haimen Rd)** – ~**82 m**
- **东长治路公平路蓬纽站** – ~**120 m**
- **东长治路海门路** – ~**141 m**
- Multiple additional stops within **300–450 m** (e.g., 公平路东长治路, 北外滩来福士站, 唐山路公平路, etc.).

Typical walking time:

- **Closest bus stops:** 80–150 m → **1–3 minutes** to the mall entrance.
- Slightly further stops (250–450 m): **4–7 minutes**.

Given North Bund’s role as a major CBD + residential area, these stops together likely handle **tens of thousands of passenger boardings/alightings per weekday**; a conservative capture of **3–7%** of those flows into the mall is plausible, aligning with the **≈195 mall/metro transient customers/day** in the previous estimate.

### 1.3 Train

- No intercity train station within 800 m; main Shanghai railway terminals (Shanghai Station, Hongqiao, etc.) are several km away and accessed via metro and bus.  
- For this coffee shop, **train is not a primary direct feeder**, but generates indirect flows via metro Line 12.

## 2. Parking availability

Within **~200 m** of the mall, there is a dense supply of structured underground parking:

Key facilities (distance from the coffee shop building):

- **Raffles City North Bund underground parking (北外滩来福士广场地下停车场)**  
  - Multiple labeled entrances/exits:
    - 东大名路/海门路 side: **~100–120 m**
    - Office tower west side: **~110–120 m**
  - Type: public mall/office parking.

- **Ludipu Chuang Business Building underground parking (绿地浦创商务大厦地下停车场)**  
  - ~**100–160 m**
  - Public underground with several entry/exit points.

- **North Bund Center underground parking (北外滩中心地下停车场)**  
  - ~**110 m** (public).

- **Jian’ai Building parking (建爱大厦停车场 & 地下停车场)**  
  - ~**150–180 m**.

- **Oriental Seaport International Building underground parking (东方海港国际大厦)**  
  - ~**175–190 m**.

Within a **600 m radius** there are **>10 separate structured parking facilities**, with combined capacity easily in the **low thousands of spaces** (typical: 400–900 spaces per CBD tower/mall garage).  

Implications:

- Office workers who **drive and park in‑tower or in Raffles City garages** have **≤3–6 minutes indoor walking** to B2.
- Residents and hotel guests arriving by car/taxi also have abundant parking with **≤5 minutes** walk to mall entrances.

## 3. Customer flow analysis

Using the previous customer analysis plus the transit/parking context:

### 3.1 Main origin groups and paths

1. **Office workers (in‑tower + nearby CBD)**
   - In‑tower workers (Raffles City office towers): **≥10,000**.
   - Nearby North Bund offices: additional **5,000–8,000**.
   - Path:
     - Morning: Metro Line 12 → Tilanqiao Exit 2/3 → direct internal access into B2/B1 → take escalator/lift up to office lobbies.
     - Lunchtime / coffee breaks: office lobby → internal mall circulation → B2 corridor.
   - Flow concentration:
     - **08:00–10:00:** work arrival.
     - **12:00–14:00:** lunch and coffee.
     - **16:30–19:30:** leaving offices, after‑work visits.

2. **Nearby residents (0–1,000 m)**
   - Within 500 m: **17,183 residents**, incl. **~11,000 working‑age**.
   - Within 1,000 m: **~68,000 residents**, incl. **~44,000 working‑age**.
   - Paths:
     - Walk from residential compounds north and west → cross Dongchangzhi Rd / Changyang Rd → enter mall at street level → down to B2.
     - Some may take **1–2 stops by bus** along Dongdaming Rd or Dongchangzhi Rd, then walk 2–4 minutes to the mall.
   - Flow concentration:
     - **07:30–09:00 & 17:00–20:30:** commute‑related detours before/after work.
     - **Weekends 11:00–21:00:** shopping, family outings.

3. **Metro‑transit passengers (non‑office workers)**
   - Use Tilanqiao Station as transfer / access to other destinations (Bund, residential, schools, jobs).
   - Daily mall‑adjacent metro footfall estimated: **8,000–20,000** passers‑by at B2 level.
   - Path: Station concourse and exits are **integrated with B2/B1**; many passengers **must pass B2 corridors** to reach the street or bus interchanges.

4. **Hotels & tourists**
   - Within 1 km: **>1,500 hotel rooms**, **~1,350 staying guests/night** at 60% occupancy.
   - If **20%** visit Raffles City daily → **~270 mall visitors/day**, with only **~10** daily coffee customers estimated specifically for this shop (overlapping with other segments).
   - Path: walk **5–15 minutes** from hotels along riverside promenades and CBD streets → enter mall at L1 → down to B2 for F&B.

5. **Schools & education institutions**
   - Several schools and a conservatory campus within **500–800 m**.
   - Flow: students + staff walking or busing via Dongdaming / Dongchangzhi roads → occasional detours into mall.
   - Estimated contribution: **~10 coffee customers/day** directly, but important for afternoon peaks in dessert/juice/soft drinks if menu targets them.

### 3.2 Internal mall circulation

- The shop is on **B2**, near the **metro‑linked level**.
- B2 typically houses:
  - Convenience F&B, casual dining, supermarket, service shops.
- Because of metro integration:
  - **15–30% of total mall visits** walk through B2.
  - For daily mall visits of **40,000–80,000**, this equals **6,000–24,000** B2 visitors/day.
  - Previous estimate of **8,000–20,000 passers‑by/day near this unit** is consistent.

### 4.2 Detour distances & times

Using the tool’s map analysis:

1. **Metro Exit (M) → Mall (A)**
   - Straight‑line: ~**200–250 m**.
   - Pedestrian route (through mall access): ~**250–300 m**.
   - Time: **3–4 minutes** to reach B2 unit from gates (including vertical circulation).
   - **Detour nature:** For office workers going from metro to upstairs offices, the coffee shop can be **directly on their default path** or require **≤1 minute extra**.

2. **Bus stop (B) → Mall (A)**
   - Distance: ~**300–350 m**.
   - Time: **4–6 minutes** walking.
   - **Extra detour** for someone whose end destination is **outside** the mall but near the bus stop:
     - Entering mall and going to B2 adds **~5–8 minutes total** (in and out) compared to walking directly home/office.

3. **Residential area (R) → Mall (A)**
   - Distance: ~**450–550 m**.
   - Time: **7–9 minutes** walking.
   - For **residents commuting via Tilanqiao Metro**, the coffee shop is on the way; detour ≤**3 minutes**.
   - For residents just going to the mall:
     - This is within a **normal 10‑minute neighborhood walk**; no additional detour in a practical sense.

4. **Office cluster (O) → Mall (A)**
   - Distance: ~**500–650 m**.
   - Time: **8–10 minutes** walking.
   - For office workers who already use the mall for lunch/after work:
     - Coffee visit adds **0–3 minutes** extra time.
   - For those going directly between office and metro station without using the mall:
     - Entering B2 adds **~5–8 minutes**.

### 4.3 5‑min / 10‑min detour range (focusing on key customer segments)

Assuming **average walking speed: 4.5–5 km/h (75–85 m/min)**:

- **5‑minute band (≤400 m additional walking)**
  - Metro passengers: **All** Tilanqiao exit users; detour ≤5 minutes.
    - Estimated **8,000–20,000** passers‑by/day in B2.
  - In‑tower office workers in Raffles City and adjacent towers:
    - **≈10,000 in‑tower + a portion of the 5,000–8,000 nearby**; detour ≤5 minutes from desks to shop and back for takeaway.
  - Residents in **0–400 m radius**:
    - Roughly **5,000–6,000 residents** (matches prior estimate of ~6,000 within 300 m).
  - Realistic “can detour within 5 minutes” potential population (daytime):
    - **Office workers + metro flow + immediate residents**: on the order of **>20,000 unique individuals** moving in/through the area daily.

- **10‑minute band (≤800 m additional walking)**
  - Covers:
    - Almost all residents in the **0–800 m** belt north and west (part of the ~68,000 within 1 km).
    - Additional office clusters to the south‑east and along the riverside.
    - Nearby schools and hotels.
  - Effective reachable population in day‑to‑day life:
    - Taking **60–70%** of residents within 1 km as realistically willing to walk 10 minutes to a major mall → **~40,000–48,000 residents**.
    - Plus **15,000–18,000 office workers** and visitors.
  - So total population that can **include this coffee shop with ≤10 minutes detour** in daily routines is plausibly **>60,000 individuals**.

This scale aligns with the deterministic estimate of **~475 customers/day** under moderate capture rates; even a **1% conversion** of daily transiting/working/walking population would yield several hundred coffee customers.

## 5. Visibility analysis

### 5.1 Macro street visibility

- Raffles City North Bund sits at/near:
  - **Dongdaming Road (东大名路)** – a **major east–west arterial** connecting North Bund with central Shanghai.
  - Intersection with **Haimen Road (海门路)** and close to **Dongchangzhi Road / Changyang Road** corridor.
- The mall’s **L1–L3 façades** are directly visible from these main roads and multiple bus stops.
- **Vehicle and bus flows** on Dongdaming Rd are heavy during peak hours (commuter traffic to/from North Bund).

However:

- The coffee shop itself is located at **B2 level**, unit 26A:
  - It is **not directly visible from street level**.
  - Visibility is **limited to mall interior corridors** and potentially metro‑linked concourses.
- External visibility depends on:
  - **Mall pylon signage & external wayfinding** (listing brand at tower and entrance directories).
  - **Digital mapping and online POIs** for customers searching “coffee” near Tilanqiao / North Bund.

### 5.2 Internal mall visibility

- As B2 is the **metro‑linked level**, corridors near the metro entrance can have **strong linear flows**.
- The exact visibility will depend on:
  - Whether unit 26A is **on the primary walking spine** between:
    - Metro exits,
    - Supermarket (if any on B2),
    - Escalators to B1/L1.
  - Or on a **secondary side corridor**.

Given the earlier assumption that B2 captures **8,000–20,000 passers‑by/day near the shop**, it implies:
- The store is likely **either on or adjacent (≤20–30 m) to a primary footfall corridor**.
- If so, the store can achieve:
  - **Unplanned impulse visits** from commuters.
  - Solid **peak‑hour queues** without heavy detours.

## 6. Summary: Traffic Pros & Cons

### Pros (traffic perspective)

- **Direct metro integration:**
  - Tilanqiao Station (Line 12) exits within **~100–150 m** of the mall.
  - Total walk from gate to shop **~4–6 minutes**; for many office workers this is on their **default path**, extra detour **≤1–3 minutes**.
  - Metro‑linked B2 level estimated **8,000–20,000 daily passers‑by** near the shop.

- **Dense bus network:**
  - ≥5 bus stops within **≤200 m**, many more within **≤600 m**.
  - Bus riders can reach mall entrances in **2–7 minutes**, extra coffee detour **≤5–8 minutes**.

- **Extensive parking:**
  - Multiple underground parking lots within **≤200 m** (Raffles City, North Bund Center, Ludipu Chuang, Jian’ai, Oriental Seaport, etc.).
  - Combined capacity likely **>1,000 spaces** within a 600 m radius.
  - Car‑borne office workers and residents can access the shop via direct mall elevators in **≤3–6 minutes**.

- **Large 5–10 minute catchment:**
  - **5‑minute detour band** (≤400 m extra walking) includes:
    - All metro exit users,
    - In‑tower office workers (~10,000+),
    - ≈**5,000–6,000 residents** within 300–400 m.
  - **10‑minute detour band** (≤800 m extra walking) covers:
    - Majority of **~68,000 residents** within 1 km (practically ~40,000–48,000),
    - Plus **15,000–18,000 office workers**, hotels, and schools.
  - Realistic reachable population with ≤10 minutes detour: **>60,000 individuals**.

- **Aligned with commuter flows:**
  - Strong **AM/PM peaks** from metro–office commuters.
  - **Lunch and afternoon** flows from in‑tower and nearby offices.
  - Weekend and evening flows from **residents + tourists** walking from riverside and hotels.

### Cons (traffic perspective)

- **Street‑level invisibility:**
  - Unit is on **B2**, not visible from Dongdaming Rd or other main roads.
  - Relies on:
    - Internal mall wayfinding,
    - Tenant mix around B2,
    - Digital discovery (maps/apps),
    - Mall promotional channels.
  - For people not already entering the mall or metro, **no spontaneous curbside discovery**.

- **Dependence on internal circulation design:**
  - If unit 26A is **off the main B2 spine**, effective passer‑by numbers can drop sharply.
  - Heavy reliance on whether:
    - Metro flows are funneled past the storefront, or
    - Have alternate shortcuts to elevators/exits that bypass it.

- **Detour sensitivity for non‑mall users:**
  - For bus riders or nearby offices **not** habitually using the mall, a visit may add **5–10 minutes** to their route, reducing visit frequency.
  - Some nearby office clusters (O) are at **~8–10 minutes walk**; this is acceptable for lunch but less convenient for short breaks.

- **Competition for commuter attention:**
  - Metro‑linked B2 corridors usually contain **multiple coffee/tea/juice brands**.
  - With many choices in the same **4–6 minute travel envelope**, capture depends heavily on:
    - Position on the main path,
    - Queue and service speed,
    - Brand recognition and pricing.

---

### Overall traffic conclusion

From a traffic and accessibility standpoint, this location is **strongly supported** by:

- Direct integration with **Tilanqiao Metro Station (Line 12)**,
- A **dense bus network**,
- Abundant **structured parking**,
- A **large, walkable residential and office catchment** of **>60,000 people** within a practical ≤10‑minute detour.

The main structural risk is **limited direct street visibility** due to the B2 position and **dependence on internal mall footfall routing**. If the unit aligns with the primary metro–office spine on B2, the traffic conditions are consistent with the earlier sales potential estimates of **~475 customers/day** in a conservative scenario, and **upwards of ~900–1,000/day** under good execution and tenant positioning.
