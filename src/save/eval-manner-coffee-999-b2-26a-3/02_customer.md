## 2. Population Demographics Around the Site

WorldPop data (500 m radius) around 31.252512, 121.507406:

| Radius | Total Population | 0–14 yrs | 15–59 yrs | 60–64 yrs | 65+ yrs |
|--------|------------------|----------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| 500 m  | 17,183           | 1,115    | 11,044    | 1,836     | 3,892   |

Age share within 500 m:

- 0–14: **6.5%**  
- 15–59: **64.3%**  
- 60–64: **10.7%**  
- 65+: **22.7%**

For a coffee shop, key is **working‑age (15–59)** and younger retirees who visit malls. Within 500 m there are about **11,000 working‑age residents**.  

Since the tool failed for 300 m / 1,000 m batch query, we approximate:

- Typical Shanghai inner‑city densities: 30,000–40,000 people / km².  
- Area of a circle:
  - 300 m radius ≈ 0.28 km² → estimated **8,000–11,000** residents  
  - 1,000 m radius ≈ 3.14 km² → estimated **95,000–125,000** residents  

Given 17,183 people within 500 m (0.79 km²), density ≈ 21,700 / km² – a bit lower than the densest residential blocks, reflecting presence of offices and riverfront land. Using this density:

- **300 m radius (~0.28 km²):**  
  - Estimated residents ≈ 0.28 × 21,700 ≈ **6,000**  
  - Working‑age (64.3%): ≈ **3,900**

- **1,000 m radius (~3.14 km²):**  
  - Estimated residents ≈ 3.14 × 21,700 ≈ **68,000**  
  - Working‑age (~64.3%): ≈ **44,000**

These are **residential only**; daytime population is significantly higher due to offices, mall visitors, and hotels (see below).

## 3. Nearby Places (Within ~1,000 m)

### 3.1 In‑mall & immediate adjacency (0–300 m)

- **Raffles City The Bund (北外滩来福士广场)** – mixed‑use complex  
  - 2 × 50‑storey Grade A office towers  
  - 6‑storey retail podium (your unit in B2)  
- **Tilanqiao Metro Station (提篮桥)** – Line 12  
  - Multiple exits; Exit 3 is ~100 m from the shop  
- **Nearby malls / retail clusters (~200–300 m)**  
  - Xingyuehui Plaza (星乐汇广场) – ~250 m  
  - Film / entertainment cluster “影梦里” – ~220 m  

### 3.2 Offices & business (approximate, based on developer info & district planning)

Within 500–800 m (North Bund CBD area):

- Multiple Grade A office towers associated with:
  - Raffles City The Bund offices (2 towers, 50 floors each)  
  - Adjacent North Bund office towers along Dongdaming Rd and Dalian Rd  
- Typical Grade A office tower in Shanghai:  
  - 40–50 floors, average 1,500–2,000 m² / floor  
  - 1 person per 12–15 m²  
  - Approx. **4,000–7,000 workers per large tower** when fully occupied  

Even with conservative occupancy, the two Raffles City towers likely host **≥8,000–10,000 office workers**; nearby towers can add several thousands more.

### 3.3 Residential compounds (0–1,000 m)

Within 500–1,000 m, the WorldPop numbers and building patterns indicate:

- Dense residential neighborhoods north of Dongdaming Rd and toward Houshan Rd & Linqing Rd (虹口老社区 + some newer riverside residential).  
- Based on calculated 500 m population (17,000) and 1,000 m population (~68,000), there are **tens of thousands of residents** in walking distance.

### 3.4 Schools & education (up to 700 m)

From nearby place search:

- Hongkou District Linqing Road Kindergarten & branches (~200 m / 600 m)  
- Hushan Road Primary School (虹口区霍山路小学) (~450–540 m)  
- Shanghai Middle School (虹口 campus) (~450 m)  
- Tongji University affiliated Chunchong Middle School (同济大附中初中部) (~550 m)  
- Jiangnan Continuing Education Institute, Changhong Technology Continuing Education Institute (~630–640 m)  
- Shanghai Conservatory of Music campus & kindergarten (~735–820 m)

These add recurring flows of **students, staff, and parents** – periodic but regular coffee demand, especially teachers, staff, and parents.

### 3.5 Hotels & tourism (0–900 m)

Notable hotels within ~300–900 m:

- Shanghai Waibaidu Crystal Hotels, Shanghai Waibaidu Yue Rongzhuang, Shanghai Outer Bund Puhua Grand Hotel, Fairmont Peace‑style riverside hotels, etc. Several 4–5 star hotels are within 300–500 m.  
- Additional business hotels (如家, Book Hotel Apartments, etc.) in 300–900 m band.  

Total hotel room stock within 1 km is plausibly **>1,500 rooms**. With even 60% occupancy and 1.5 guests/room average, that’s **~1,350 staying guests per night**, plus meeting and event visitors.

### 3.6 Metro & transport

- **Tilanqiao Station (Line 12):** ≤150 m  
- **Dalian Road Station (Line 12 & 4)**: ~750–850 m  
- Several bus routes along Dongdaming Road and Dalian Road.  
Combined, this creates a strong daily commuter and transfer stream crossing the B2 concourse areas.

## 4. Raffles City The Bund – Mall Traffic

Public information gives building description but not explicit, official footfall data, so we infer based on comparable Raffles City properties and scale.

From CapitaLand / architecture sources:

- 2 Grade A office towers (50 storeys)  
- 6‑storey retail podium  
- Located in core North Bund waterfront CBD

Comparable CapitaLand Raffles City malls in tier‑1 cities typically show:

- Mature daily footfall range: **50,000–100,000 visits/day** on weekdays, higher on weekends for flagship CBD sites.  

Given:

- Direct connection / adjacency to Metro Line 12 (Tilanqiao)  
- Two large office towers sitting on the mall podium  
- Prime riverside CBD with hotels and tourists

A **conservative working estimate** for Raffles City The Bund’s total mall footfall:

- **Weekday average:** **40,000–70,000 visits/day**  
- **Weekend average:** **60,000–90,000 visits/day**  

To be conservative for planning, we’ll use:

- **Deterministic planning figure:** **40,000 visits/day** (lower bound)  
- **Potential upper figure:** **80,000 visits/day** (reasonable upside scenario when fully matured)

Your shop is on **B2**, likely closer to metro flows and parking – strongly dependent on how passenger flows are guided (escalators, wayfinding, tenant mix), but B2 in metro‑connected malls can capture **15–30%** of total mall visitors if circulation is good.

Assuming 20% of mall visitors pass near your corridor:

- Deterministic: 40,000 × 20% ≈ **8,000 passers‑by/day**  
- Potential: 80,000 × 25% ≈ **20,000 passers‑by/day** (if B2 becomes a food & convenience hub)

---

## 5. Main Customer Sources & Volume Estimates

### 5.1 Office workers (in‑tower + nearby towers)

Raffles City towers (2 × 50F):

- Approx. office GFA:  
  - Assume 45 floors of offices/tower × 1,600 m²/floor × 2 towers = 144,000 m²  
  - At 14 m²/person: ≈ **10,300 office workers** in‑tower (round to **10,000**)

Nearby Grade A/B offices within 10 min walk could conservatively add another **5,000–8,000** workers.

- **Deterministic office catchment:** ≈ **12,000 workers**  
- **Potential (including more nearby towers):** ≈ **18,000 workers**

Coffee purchase rate (Shanghai white‑collar benchmark):

- Assume **20–30%** buy paid coffee/tea out of home at least once daily on workdays.  
- Of those, maybe **30–50%** use this mall / this node.

Deterministic capture:

- Users: 12,000 workers × 20% coffee buyers × 40% using this node ≈ **960 coffee customers/day**  
- Drinks per customer/day (many purchase once; some twice): assume 1.1 → ≈ **1,050 cups/day** maximum **potential from office workers** mall‑wide.  
- Your single shop share depends on competition. If there are ~4–6 coffee providers in the mall/adjacent (international chains + local), your reasonable target share: **10–20%** of all office coffee spend here.

Deterministic allocation to your shop:

- 1,050 cups/day × 15% share ≈ **160 cups/day** from office workers (deterministic)  
- Potential (fully established brand, strong positioning, limited competition): up to ~30% → **315 cups/day** from office workers.

### 5.2 Residents within walking distance

Within 500 m:

- 17,183 residents;  
- Assume 64.3% working‑age = 11,044; remaining 35.7% mainly children/elderly.

Coffee/tea purchase behavior (urban Shanghai):

- Assume **10–15%** of adults make an out‑of‑home specialty beverage purchase on an average day (includes milk tea, coffee, etc.).  
- Of those, maybe **25–40%** are willing to walk to this mall node (some go elsewhere, some drink near workplaces).

Deterministic (500 m):

- Adults: assume everyone 15–64 is adult: 11,044 + 1,836 ≈ 12,880  
- Buyers: 12,880 × 10% × 30% using this node ≈ **386 beverage‑buying residents/day**  
- Allocate to your shop (assuming 5–8 competing cafes/tea shops accessible): 386 × 18% ≈ **70 resident customers/day**  

1,000 m band (additional ~50,000+ residents beyond 500 m):

- More price‑ and convenience‑sensitive; fewer will come daily.  
- Assume only 3–5% of working‑age within 500–1,000 m radius visit this node per day for shopping/dining.  
- Rough: 44,000 working‑age residents × 4% × 10% coffee buyers ≈ **176 additional beverage buyers/day** in the mall.  
- Your share at 18%: ≈ **30 customers/day**

Combined residential deterministic:

- **≈100 customers/day**  
- Potential (after strong brand building, delivery + take‑away, etc.): **~200 customers/day**

### 5.3 Mall / metro transient flow (non‑local visitors, commuters, tourists)

From mall footfall estimates:

- Deterministic mall visitors: 40,000/day  
- Subtract office workers using mall counted earlier (we assume 10,000 visits by in‑tower workers already included in 40,000; keep them in total to avoid double counting, but more precise segmentation is complex).  

Coffee conversion assumptions:

- Among generic mall visitors and commuters, assume **5–8%** buy a paid drink during their visit.  
- Of those, some go to bubble tea, juices, etc. Let coffee share be ~40–50%.

Deterministic:

- 40,000 visits/day × 6% beverage buyers = **2,400 beverage purchases/day**  
- Coffee share 45% → **1,080 coffee purchases/day** within mall  
- Your shop share (depending on brand, visibility, competition) – assume **15–25%**:

  - Deterministic (mid‑range): 1,080 × 18% ≈ **195 customers/day**  
  - Potential (strong performance): 1,080 × 25% ≈ **270 customers/day**

If mall matures to 80,000 visitors/day:

- 80,000 × 6% × 45% ≈ **2,160 coffee purchases/day**  
- At 20% share: **432 customers/day**

### 5.4 Hotel guests & tourists

Hotels within 1 km: estimated >1,500 rooms, ~1,350 guests/night at 60% occupancy.

Not all will pass your node. Assume:

- 40% of guests visit this mall at least once per stay  
- Average stay 2 nights → 1 mall visit / 2 days → 0.5 visit/guest/day  
- Visitor flow from hotels into mall per day:  
  - 1,350 guests × 40% × 0.5 ≈ **270 mall visits/day**  

Coffee conversion and your share:

- 30% of those buy a beverage → 270 × 30% ≈ **81 beverage customers/day**  
- Coffee share 50% → **40 coffee customers/day**  
- Your shop’s share (if 3–5 cafes competing): 40 × 25% ≈ **10 hotel/tourist coffee customers/day** (conservative).  
Potential if you are prominently located and collaborative with hotels: **20–30 customers/day**.

### 5.5 Schools / education institutions

Population:

- Several primary, middle schools, kindergarten, and higher‑ed institutions within 500–800 m.  
- Combined staff + senior students likely in the low **thousands**.

Coffee demand:

- Focus on teachers, staff, college students, and parents, not small children.  
- Assume 1,500 relevant individuals, 5–10% buy coffee/tea near this node on school days:

  - 1,500 × 7% ≈ **105 beverage buyers/day (school days)**  
  - Coffee share 40% → **42 coffee customers/day**; your share 25% → **10–12/day** on school days.

Add to deterministic daily average (including weekends/holidays): **~8–10 customers/day**.

---

## 6. Consolidated Customer Number Estimation

### 6.1 Deterministic daily customer estimate

Summing conservative estimates (coffee‑buying customers to your shop):

- Office workers: **~160/day**  
- Residents: **~100/day**  
- Mall / metro transients: **~195/day**  
- Hotels / tourists: **~10/day**  
- Schools / education: **~10/day**

**Deterministic total:**  
**≈ 475 customers/day**

If average spend per head is 30–35 RMB (coffee + possible add‑ons), deterministic daily revenue band:

- 475 × 30 ≈ **14,250 RMB/day**  
- 475 × 35 ≈ **16,625 RMB/day**

### 6.2 Potential upper daily customer estimate

Using optimistic but still grounded conditions:

- Office workers: **~300/day**  
- Residents (incl. wider radius, strong loyalty): **~200/day**  
- Mall / metro transients (higher mall footfall + better corridor position): **~350–430/day**  
- Hotels / tourists (better cross‑promotions): **~20–30/day**  
- Schools / education: **~15/day**

**Potential total (rounded):**  
**≈ 900–1,000 customers/day**

Using same spend:

- 900 × 30 = **27,000 RMB/day**, upper range **~30,000–35,000 RMB/day** if basket size rises or you sell food as well.

For planning, a **practical operating target** could be set around **550–650 customers/day** once the mall stabilizes and the shop matures, which sits between deterministic and potential extremes.

## 7. Main Customer Sources Summary

- **Primary sources (largest volumes):**
  - Office workers in Raffles City The Bund towers and adjacent offices (workday peak: mornings, lunch, afternoon).  
  - Mall / metro transient visitors (metro‑linked B2 + intra‑mall circulation).  
- **Secondary sources:**
  - Local residents within 300–800 m (evenings, weekends).  
  - Nearby hotel guests and riverfront tourists.  
  - School / education staff and older students.

---

## 8. Pros & Cons of the Location (Customer Perspective)

### Pros

- **High daytime population density:**
  - ≥10,000 in‑tower office workers, plus several thousand more in walking distance.
- **Significant mall footfall:**
  - Conservative **40,000 daily visits**, potential **80,000**, with B2 benefiting from metro connection.
- **Strong residential base:**
  - ~17,000 residents within 500 m; ~68,000 within 1,000 m, providing off‑peak and weekend demand.
- **Multiple complementary demand drivers:**
  - Grade A offices, hotels, schools, riverfront leisure, and metro transfers.
- **All‑day demand potential:**
  - Breakfast / commuting, mid‑morning office breaks, lunch, afternoon coffee, evening leisure.

### Cons

- **Competition risk:**
  - A Raffles City‑scale mall almost certainly hosts international coffee chains and local boutique brands; share of wallet per operator is constrained.
- **B2 positioning:**
  - While good for metro traffic, B2 may be less visible to upper‑level shoppers. If escalator alignment and signage are poor, conversion may be lower than estimates.
- **Office‑dependence:**
  - A high proportion of projected volume is from office workers and commuters; any downturn in occupancy or more work‑from‑home will directly hit weekday sales.
- **Tourism / hotel seasonality:**
  - Tourist and conference flows can fluctuate strongly by season and macro factors.

## 9. Conclusion

- The North Bund Raffles City location offers **quantitatively strong customer potential** for a coffee shop:
  - Residential base: **~17k within 500 m**, majority working‑age.  
  - Office + mall + metro + hotel flows combine to support **deterministic ~475 daily customers**, with **potential up to ~1,000/day** under favorable conditions and good execution.
- Success will depend heavily on:
  - Securing strong visibility from metro/B2 circulation paths,  
  - Differentiating from other coffee brands in taste, price, and speed, and  
  - Targeting key segments (office workers and commuters) with clear time‑of‑day offers.

From a pure customer potential standpoint, the site is **numerically solid**, with clear upside if the mall reaches full maturity and the coffee shop is well‑positioned within its internal traffic flows.
