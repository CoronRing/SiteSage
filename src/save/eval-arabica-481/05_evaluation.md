# Evaluation Scores

## Customer Analysis: 4.5/10
The report clearly describes a mixed residential–medical–education street location with decent but not high-intensity passing flows. It estimates a conservative 60–150 weekday customers and 200–350 with good execution, implying repeat person-times within ~30–40 m more in the 2,000–6,000/day range and deterministic repeat cups roughly 60–150/day, which fits the 3.0–4.9 band for the weekday repeat base (scored 4.0). Morning-peak volume is limited by being 400–500 m from metro stations and dependent on dispersed residents, hospital, and campus walkers rather than a tight commuter funnel, suggesting perhaps 700–2,000 morning passers and 30–80 cups in 3 hours, consistent with a 3.0–4.9 band (3.5). The leisure/tourist side is helpful but not massive on weekdays: nearby upscale hotels and some “网红打卡” traffic add perhaps tens of weekday cups and several thousand incremental leisure passers at most, so a weak-to-moderate 3.0–4.9 leisure band (4.0) is appropriate. Storefront exposure is reasonable for a street shop on a known lifestyle street but not on a primary transit conduit; likely only a modest share of the wider node’s flows pass the door naturally, matching the 10–25% / secondary-corridor description and a mid-band “moderate exposure” score of 6.0. Competition is present (Picniq and other cafés/bistros in a 500–1,000 m radius) but not quantified as heavily oversaturated; given total realistic node demand of perhaps ~700–1,500 cups/day for all operators and the need for differentiation, the situation fits the “tight but viable” 5.0–7.4 band (6.0). Flow stability is strong: the area is established inner-city with large, durable anchors (major hospital, universities, CAS institutes, dense housing) and no signs of structural decline, warranting a “stable with upside” 8.0. Demographically, the reachable base includes many students, researchers, doctors, and mid/high-income residents plus a sizable but not dominant elderly share; this supports specialty coffee at mid–high price points and aligns with the 40–60% target-segment “good fit” band (8.0). With modest repeat and morning-peak scores, the weighted average ends at about 4.5/10, well below global caps and consistent with a community-strength but non-prime customer potential profile.

## Traffic & Accessibility: 5.2/10
The report shows a solid commuter-oriented context but with limited true doorstep flow. For A, the storefront sits on a secondary neighborhood artery between two intersections, not on the primary metro–hospital desire line, so despite meaningful local movement the implied 07:00–10:00 pass-by within 0–30 m is more consistent with a side corridor (≈3,000–5,999), yielding a 4.0. B scores 7.5 because for the main relevant groups (hospital/科研↔residents, metro↔hospital/residents) extra detour is typically 0–200 m (1.5–3 minutes) with intuitive paths, though it is not perfectly on-path for all metro commuters. C is 7.5 since the area’s flows are dominated by repeat commuters—medical staff, researchers, students and local residents—with clear morning/weekday usage and relatively minor reliance on nightlife/leisure compared to nearby衡山路. D is 6.0: there are two strong multi-line metro stations with 150k–220k daily entries/exits, but the report explicitly notes only a small fraction naturally walks toward the store, so effective captured transit volume is moderate and constrained by a detour cap. E scores 7.5 because within 1 km there are about 88k residents plus 8.5k–13k workers, giving a dense urban base near or above 100k. F is low at 1.5; the unit is a streetfront shop without integrated towers or indoor linkage, and nearby hotel/housing are adjacent rather than same-complex captive, so true captive indoor population is <1,000. G scores 6.0: along its own street segment visibility and line-of-sight are good, but it is not at a main node or junction and requires minor deviation from the heaviest transit flows. H is strong at 8.0 due to 400–700 spaces within 300 m, 1,000–1,500 within 800 m, and convenient drop-off 50–150 m away. Combining these with the specified weights yields an overall score of 5.2, with the relatively weak direct morning pass-by and minimal captive base constraining the location to a mid-tier accessibility profile for commuter-focused specialty coffee despite otherwise favorable context.

## Competition Analysis: 3.2/10
The report itself estimates realistic sustainable volume for a new store at roughly 150–250 cups/day in a best-case, well-executed scenario, placing RSV clearly below 250 on average; this supports a low Effective Node Volume score (2.5) in the rubric’s ‘failing/marginal’ band. Saturation is described as very high: ~18 coffee-first outlets within 500 m and 35–45 within 1 km for a catchment of ~20k residents plus 8.5–13k medical/academic workers, with the author explicitly calling the node ‘供给偏多’ and noting that adding a similar store mostly intensifies competition; this aligns with ‘Poor’ saturation (3.5), driven by high outlets-per-buyer. The report does articulate some credible differentiation (mid-price 22–30 RMB, academic/medical theme, B2B and evening focus), but also makes clear that all major formats—premium (%Arabica, M Stand), value chains (Luckin-type, Cotti), mass specialty (Manner), and community independents—are already present on the same corridor, and the incremental uplift versus a generic offer is likely ≤150 cups/day; this fits a ‘Poor–Adequate’ white-space band, scored at 4.0. Anchor risk is significant but not extreme: a %Arabica unit is effectively co-located at 3 m with overlapping use cases, and several other strong chains lie within a few hundred meters, yet within 0–100 m there is essentially one top-tier chain plus a small independent, not a full cluster of flagships; this corresponds to a mid-range ‘Adequate/Good’ risk score (6.5). Applying the rubric’s RSV gate for Effective Node Volume ≤2.9 caps the overall score at a maximum of 4.5, and the weighted sum of dimensions (3.2) remains below that cap, reflecting a node where strong cluster volume and differentiation options do not fully offset structurally low new-store share and heavy saturation.
