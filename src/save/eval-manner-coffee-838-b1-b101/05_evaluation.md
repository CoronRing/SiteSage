# Evaluation Scores

## Customer Analysis: 7.2/10
The report describes a dense mixed office–residential–tourist CBD node with direct metro adjacency and a mall location, and estimates a mature-store baseline of ~400–800 cups/day, centred around 600–700. Most of this appears to come from repeat users (office workers, commuting residents, students, in-mall workers), with only a smaller portion from tourists and hotel guests, so a conservative repeat base of ~450–550 cups/day is reasonable. Given the sizeable office cluster (15k–23k workers), ~30k residents within 500 m, and a heavily used metro node, even after applying a realistic corridor share for a B1 mall unit, repeat passers likely exceed 18k/day, placing criterion 1 in the strong band at 8.0. However, the storefront is in B1 of a community/lifestyle mall rather than directly on a station concourse or unavoidable street throat, so the compressed morning funnel is weaker: with 600–700 cups/day, a cautious estimate of 150–250 cups in the 3‑hour 07:30–10:30 window (mostly repeat) supports a moderate–strong but not prime commuter peak, scored 6.5. The all‑day leisure base is clearly strong, with 12k–15k mall visitors, plus spillover from LU·One, nearby malls, tourists moving between Xintiandi/Tianzifang, and hotel guests; incremental non‑repeat cups of 100–200/day are plausible, meriting 8.0 for criterion 3. Exposure is good but not perfect: the store benefits from being in the core mall and close to station-linked flows, yet is still on B1 and dependent on mall circulation and vertical links, so it likely captures 20–40% of relevant flows rather than a majority, leading to a 7.0 for criterion 4. Competition is described as strong within the mall, in adjacent LU·One, and around the station; with node-level coffee demand seemingly in the several-thousand-cups/day range, but many chains and tea brands sharing it, the balance looks tight but viable, giving 6.5 for criterion 5. Flow stability is high: this is a mature central Huangpu location with enduring anchors (Grade A offices, metro Lines 9 & 13, multiple malls, universities and hospitals), and no major concentration risk to a single fragile attraction, so 8.5 is appropriate for criterion 6. Finally, demographics and price fit are excellent: the catchment has a high share of working-age white-collar workers, students, medical staff, and mid/high-end mall shoppers in a central Shanghai district already rich in coffee brands, so criterion 7 scores 9.0. These subscores combine to an overall customer-potential score of 7.2, with no global caps triggered since both repeat-base and morning-peak scores exceed 5 and repeat users form well over half of reachable flows.

## Traffic & Accessibility: 5.6/10
The report describes a location with very strong macro fundamentals but only moderate-to-weak true pass-by at the storefront for a commuter-focused coffee shop. Morning flows are clearly large around Madang Rd Station (70,000–100,000/day) and in the surrounding office-residential cluster, yet the unit sits on B1 inside Zhonghai Huanyu Hui with no street frontage, and its exact position on the B1 spine is uncertain; using the rubric’s requirement to assume the narrowest plausible corridor, this supports only a weak A score (≈3,000–5,000 morning passers, score 4.0). Detour and path fit are moderate (6.0): metro and same-project office users already entering the mall face very low extra time (0–2 minutes), but many other commuters remain at street level or in neighboring malls, needing 3–6+ minutes of extra walk. Commuter composition is strong (8.0) given substantial office workers, students, and residents with clear morning/evening peaks, and macro transit relevance is moderate (5.5) because only about 10–15% of a large hub’s flows naturally orient toward this project despite the two metro lines. The 1 km density of residents (~120,000) plus workers (15,000–23,000) is high (8.0), and the same-complex captive base (offices atop/within Huanyu Hui) is meaningfully sized, in the 3,000–6,999 range (6.0). In-project visibility is only moderate (5.0) since the unit is B1, not guaranteed on the main spine or by a key escalator, and relies heavily on internal circulation rather than organic street discovery. Car access is excellent (9.0) with 2,000–3,000 parking spaces within ~300 m and direct basement access. These components average to a raw score of about 5.6, and the global cap from sub-score A (<5.0) does not bind further, yielding a final traffic & accessibility score of 5.6/10.

## Competition Analysis: 6.3/10
The report indicates a very strong node with heavy mixed-use traffic: large resident, office, student, tourist, and metro-linked bases, and it explicitly estimates a realistic sustainable volume of about 400–800 cups/day with upside higher, which aligns with the “Strong” RSV band (600–799) and supports an Effective Node Volume score around 7.3. However, saturation is clearly high: roughly 15+ direct coffee competitors within ~200 m and 35–45 coffee shops (plus many dessert/tea venues) within 1 km, implying dense per-capita competition; in a CBD this warrants a ‘Poor’ but not extreme saturation score (about 4.0) per the rubric. The analysis shows that generic offers will struggle yet identifies several viable but execution-dependent niches (fast commuter coffee, higher-end specialty/hand brew, dessert-focused café, community/third-place), which fits ‘Adequate’ positioning white space with incremental uplift likely in the 150–250 cups/day range, justifying a score of 6.0. Anchor risk is substantial: Manner, multiple Starbucks (including a Reserve), Luckin, M Stand, Peet’s and others are all within roughly 0–200 m on the same flows, satisfying the rubric’s conditions for ‘Poor’ anchor/incumbent risk (≥4 strong chains on the same corridor) and supporting a score around 3.5. Combining these with the specified weights yields a final competition & node potential score of approximately 6.3, with no gating caps triggered given the strong node volume and absence of a hero flagship directly co-located within 0–10 m.
