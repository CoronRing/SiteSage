# Weighting Rationale

- **Store context**
  - Coffee shop located on B1 of Zhonghai Huanyu Hui commercial complex on Huangpi South Road, Shanghai.
  - Mall-based, enclosed environment with strong dependence on internal foot traffic and nearby office/shopping flows.

- **Customer (0.31)**
  - Broad appeal but with meaningful segmentation: office workers, mall employees, shoppers, and nearby residents.
  - Repeat visits and daily habits (morning coffee, afternoon breaks) make understanding local customer density, income, and work–life patterns important.
  - Slightly above the lower range for mass-market concepts because the mix of white-collar workers and shoppers in this central Shanghai location affects price point and product mix.

- **Traffic & Accessibility (0.39)**
  - Primary driver of success: relies on high, consistent foot traffic within the commercial complex and from surrounding streets and transit.
  - B1 location means vertical accessibility (escalators, elevators, proximity to entrances and transit connections) is crucial.
  - Coffee is a high-frequency, convenience-driven purchase; visibility along main internal corridors and near transit/mall entry paths is especially important.

- **Competition (0.30)**
  - Urban Shanghai coffee market is competitive, and malls often host multiple beverage and light-food options.
  - However, differentiation via brand, quality, ambiance, and positioning (e.g., quick grab-and-go vs. sit-and-work) can reduce direct head-to-head pressure.
  - Assigned a moderate weight: competition matters, but within a busy commercial complex, capturing available traffic and matching the core customer base are slightly more decisive.
