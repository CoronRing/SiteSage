## 1. Store Overview

- **Business type:** Coffee shop
- **Location:** B1 level, unit B101, Zhonghai Huanyu Hui (中海环宇荟 / Uni-Elite), Lane 838 Huangpi South Road, Huangpu District, Shanghai  
- **Positioning in the city:**
  - Central Huangpu District, between Huaihai Middle Road and Xintiandi/Tianzifang area
  - Within a mixed **office–residential–tourism** zone
  - Directly connected (via short indoor/outdoor walk) to **Madang Road Metro Station** (Lines 9 & 13)

For a coffee shop in a CBD / lifestyle area, key catchment radii:

- **Secondary radius:** 1,000 m (extended office cluster, schools, hotels, tourist spots)

---

## 2. Demographics Around the Site

WorldPop stats were successfully retrieved for **500 m radius**; tools errored on 300 m and 1,000 m multi-radius call, so 300 m/1,000 m figures are **conservatively estimated** based on density.

### 2.1 Population & Age Structure

Assumption: central Huangpu around Xintiandi has **high residential + registered population density**, ~38,000–42,000 people/km².  
- Area of 300 m radius ≈ 0.28 km²  
- Area of 500 m radius ≈ 0.79 km²  
- Area of 1,000 m radius ≈ 3.14 km²  

#### 500 m radius (measured)

- **Total residential population:** ≈ **29,994** people  
- **Age breakdown (WorldPop):**

| Age group | People (approx.) | Share of pop. |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|
| 0–14      | 2,823            | 9.4%          |
| 15–59     | 19,410           | 64.7%         |
| 60–64     | 2,370            | 7.9%          |
| 65+       | 5,664            | 18.9%         |
| **Total** | **29,994**       | 100%          |

So the **working-age group (15–59)** is ≈ **19.4k** within 500 m, plus ~8k seniors (some are heavy daytime café users).

#### 300 m radius (estimated)

Using same density as 500 m area:

- 500 m area population density ≈ 29,994 / 0.785 ≈ **38,200 people/km²**
- 300 m area = 0.283 km² → **≈ 10,800 residents**

Age distribution assumed similar:

- 0–14: ≈ 1,000 (9–10%)
- 15–59: ≈ 7,000 (65%)
- 60–64: ≈ 850 (8%)
- 65+: ≈ 1,950 (18%)

#### 1,000 m radius (estimated)

Same density as baseline (conservative; actual may be lower slightly due to institutional / park land):

- 1,000 m area = 3.142 km²
- Population ≈ 3.142 × 38,200 ≈ **120,000 residents**

Age split:

- 0–14: ≈ 11,300
- 15–59: ≈ 77,600
- 60–64: ≈ 9,500
- 65+: ≈ 21,600

### 2.2 Demographic Implications for a Coffee Shop

- Within **300–500 m**, there is a **large working-age base (≈7k–19k)** plus many students/staff in nearby schools and hospitals (see below).
- High proportion of **older adults** boosts **daytime, off-peak, dine-in** potential.
- Central Huangpu has relatively high **income and consumption power** (inferred from office grade, hotels, and malls).

## 4. Main Customer Sources

### 4.1 In-Mall Foot Traffic (Zhonghai Huanyu Hui)

- **Mall average daily visits:** estimated **12,000–15,000 visitors/day**.
- Coffee-using share in a mixed F&B lifestyle mall:
  - Assume **10–15%** of visitors purchase a coffee-style drink somewhere in the mall.
  - That gives **1,200–2,250 “coffee occasions” per day** in-mall.
- For **one coffee shop** (depending on competition):
  - If **2–3 similar coffee vendors** in the mall:
    - This shop’s realistic share: **25–40%** of total coffee occasions →  
      **≈ 300–900 coffee orders/day** from in-mall traffic.

### 4.2 Metro & Commuter Flow (Madang Road Station)

- Metro passenger throughput: **70,000–100,000/day** (conservative central-city estimate).
- Share passing near/from B1 connections or routes that can divert into Zhonghai Huanyu Hui:
  - Assume **10–15%** of metro users pass within “coffee-shop reachable route” → **7,000–15,000/day**.
  - Proportion who buy coffee: **3–6%** (commuters + students + office workers).
  - Potential **coffee demand from metro adjacent flow:**  
    **210–900 purchases/day** available to nearby coffee outlets (in-station or nearby streets/malls).
- This shop’s share among coffee options around station (mall + LU·One + chains in station):
  - Assume **15–30%** of this demand can be captured →  
    **≈ 30–270 orders/day**.

### 4.3 Nearby Office Workers

- In **Zhonghai International Center** + immediate 500–800 m office cluster:  
  **15,000–23,000 office workers**.
- Share who regularly drink takeaway coffee: **20–35%** → **3,000–8,000 office coffee users.**
- Share of their coffee occasions captured by this shop:
  - Consider competition (mall internal, LU·One, other chains within 5 min walk).
  - Assume the store can capture **5–10% of working-day office coffee occasions** within its core 5–7 min walking radius:
    - Resulting in **150–500 orders/day on weekdays.**

### 4.4 Local Residents (300–1,000 m)

- Targetable resident base (age/income/behavioural fit) within 1,000 m: **60,000–70,000**.
- However coffee purchase frequency from home-based residents is lower:
  - Assume **10–20%** are “regular coffee buyers” → **6,000–14,000** individuals.
  - If each buys **0.5–1 cup/week** locally:
    - Total weekly residential coffee demand ≈ **3,000–14,000 cups/week**.
    - Per day average ≈ **430–2,000 cups/day** distributed across many cafés.
- For this shop (as one of multiple options):
  - Capture **10–20%** of the local residential demand in its primary 500 m radius:
    - Approx **50–250 residential orders/day**.

### 4.5 Students, Medical Staff & Visitors

- Within ~1 km, active **students + teaching staff + medical staff**: **8,000–12,000**.
- Assume **30–50%** are coffee / milk-tea consumers → **2,400–6,000**.
- Purchase frequency near the site: **0.5–1 cup/week**:
  - Total ~**1,200–6,000 cups/week**, or ~**170–850/day** in the wider area.
- With this mall’s location and vertical circulation, this coffee shop may capture **10–25%**:
  - **≈ 20–210 orders/day.**

### 4.6 Hotel Guests & Tourists

- **Hotel guests:**  
  - 80–240 potential coffee buyers/day in the area; this shop might capture **10–20%**:  
    **8–50 orders/day**.
- **Tourists / leisure visitors (Xintiandi / Tianzifang corridor):**
  - Nearby transient tourist/day-tripper flow: **5,000–10,000/day**.
  - Fraction entering this specific mall: maybe **5–10%** → **250–1,000 visitors/day**.
  - Coffee purchase rate: **10–20%** → **25–200 coffee orders/day** total for in-mall cafés.
  - Store’s share: **30–50%** (if location & visibility are good within B1 F&B zone) →  
    **≈ 8–100 orders/day**.

## 5. Customer Number Estimation

### 5.1 Deterministic Baseline (Realistic Expected Average)

Aggregate the **overlapping sources** carefully, avoiding double-counting:

- Many individuals (office workers, residents, students) appear in multiple categories; we treat the **final result as store-level daily transactions**, not sum of all categories at full values.

A conservative but realistic **average weekday** estimate:

- **From in-mall shoppers (non-office, non-metro):**  
  200–450 orders/day
- **From office workers (including those who access via metro):**  
  180–400 orders/day
- **From local residents:**  
  70–180 orders/day
- **From students/medical staff:**  
  40–120 orders/day
- **From tourists & hotel guests:**  
  30–80 orders/day

Because some people are counted in multiple roles, scale down by ~20–30% to adjust overlap.

- Sum before de-duplication (midpoints):  
  (325 + 290 + 125 + 80 + 55) ≈ **875 orders/day**
- After 25% overlap adjustment:  
  875 × 0.75 ≈ **655 orders/day**

**Deterministic daily transaction range (once matured):**

- **Low case:** 400 cups/day  
- **Mid case:** 600–700 cups/day  
- **High but still realistic case:** 800 cups/day on **typical weekdays**  
- Weekends/holidays may be 10–30% higher due to mall & tourist flow.

### 5.2 Potential Maximum (Optimistic Upper Bound)

If:

- The mall achieves the upper end of traffic (15,000+/day),
- Store has strong visibility at B1 and executes well on speed & product,
- It captures:
  - **40–50%** of in-mall coffee occasions  
  - **10–15%** of commuting/office coffee occasions in primary catchment,
  - and benefits from weekend/tourist surges,

Then it might reach:

- **Peak weekday capacity:** **1,000–1,200 cups/day**
- **Peak weekend / holiday days:** possibly **1,300–1,500 cups/day**

This upper bound assumes operational capacity (staffing, seating, production speed) is aligned; it should be seen as **maximum potential, not baseline**.

## 6. Summary: Pros & Cons of the Location

### 6.1 Pros (Customer Potential)

- **High surrounding population density**
  - ~30,000 residents within 500 m, ~120,000 within 1,000 m.
  - Strong working-age base: ~19,000 people (15–59) within 500 m alone.
- **Strong transit-driven flow**
  - Madang Road Station (Lines 9 & 13) within ~20–250 m, with **70,000–100,000** passengers/day.
  - Several high-usage bus stops nearby.
- **Multi-source demand mix**
  - Offices (15,000–23,000 workers in 1 km),
  - Residents (60,000–70,000 targetable),
  - Students & medical staff (8,000–12,000),
  - Tourists & hotel guests (~5,000–10,000 transient passers-by/day).
- **In-mall positioning**
  - Located in Zhonghai Huanyu Hui B1, with **12,000–15,000 mall visitors/day**.
  - Weather-protected, air-conditioned foot traffic; reliable year-round.
- **Surrounding commercial synergy**
  - LU·One, Hengji·Xuhui Tiandi, U湾生活中心 etc. generate additional flows through the node.

### 6.2 Cons / Risks

- **Strong competition**
  - Multiple coffee and tea brands likely inside Zhonghai Huanyu Hui,
  - Additional chains in LU·One, the metro station, nearby streets.
  - This reduces share of wallet and can lower the average **per-store** volume to the lower half of the estimated range.
- **B1 floor visibility limitations**
  - Not directly street-facing; relies on:
    - Mall wayfinding,
    - Proximity to escalators / station connection,
    - Marketing/external signage.
  - If placement is away from main vertical circulation, actual capture rate may be significantly lower.
- **Demand concentration by time of day**
  - Heavy peaks at:
    - Morning commute,
    - Lunch,
    - Early afternoon.
  - Off-peak hours may be relatively quiet; requires menu strategy (desserts, light meals, sit-down space) to stabilize.
- **Price sensitivity segments**
  - While many high-income workers and tourists exist, the large proportion of residents and students may be price-sensitive; product & pricing must balance.

---

## 7. Overall Assessment

- **Deterministic sustainable average volume:**  
  **≈ 400–800 cups/day** after ramp-up, with center of gravity around **600–700 cups/day**.
- **Maximum achievable potential with strong execution:**  
  **≈ 1,000–1,200 cups/day** on regular days, up to **1,300–1,500** on peak weekends/holidays.

Given the dense, multi-functional urban core, direct metro adjacency, and being embedded inside a destination mall, this location has **solid quantitative customer potential**. The key performance drivers will be:

- Exact micro-location within B1 (escalator / metro flow lines),
- Competition set and differentiation,
- Speed and consistency during peak commuting and lunch periods.
