You plan to open a **coffee shop** in **上海市闵行区都市路5001号仲盛世界商城1层GF12商铺**. The location resolves to **仲盛世界商城 (Zhongsheng World Mall)** in Minhang District, Shanghai.

- The map center (marker A) is inside **Zhongsheng World Mall**, a large enclosed shopping mall at **都市路5001号**.
- The mall is in a **dense commercial area** with many brand tenants such as H&M, New Balance, Kiehl’s, Sephora, McDonald’s, and multiple restaurants and dessert shops.
- There is a **cinema (上影CGV)** in close proximity within the same complex, which typically drives strong evening and weekend traffic.
- Around the mall perimeter there are **public transport and parking icons**, indicating convenient access by both metro/bus and car.
- Your shop unit **GF12 on Level 1** would be within this internal mall environment, surrounded by other retail and F&B tenants, benefitting from cross-traffic between anchors (cinema, major fashion and F&B brands).
