# Boutique Coffee Shop Location Analysis

## Weights Assignment:
- **Customer Weight**: 0.2
- **Traffic Weight**: 0.4
- **Competition Weight**: 0.4

## Justification:
- **Customer**: The localized population analysis shows potential, but given the high traffic and competition scores, it's not the primary focus for this location. Hence, a lower weight.
- **Traffic**: The high traffic score, due to proximity to various transit options, suggests that foot traffic is a major contributing factor for this shop's success.
- **Competition**: With numerous competitors around, competition needs to be heavily considered, particularly regarding positioning and differentiation strategies.

The higher weights for traffic and competition reflect the dynamics of operating a coffee shop in such a location, requiring an approach that leverages traffic while effectively standing out among many nearby competitors.
