# Evaluation Scores

## Customer Analysis: 4.4/10
From the report, realistic repeat users (nearby residents, office workers, and habitual commuters) translate into roughly 240–260 deterministic cups/day for this store, but given reasonable conversion rates this implies only a few thousand repeat passers within 30–40 m, putting the site in the weak–moderate band for repeat base (criterion 1: 4.5). The morning peak is meaningful but not dominant: with an estimated ~90 cups in 07:30–10:30 driven by residents and nearby offices but no direct station‑exit funnel and a hotel‑interior placement, this fits the 30–100 cup / 700–2,000 passer band (criterion 2: 4.0). Leisure demand (hotel guests, mall shoppers, irregular visitors) is clearly present but diluted by distance and the need to enter the hotel; incremental weekday cups from these users are likely in the tens rather than hundreds, consistent with a weak–moderate leisure score (criterion 3: 4.0). Exposure is described as structurally constrained: the shop is inside a hotel with lower visibility than street‑corner locations, and the author themselves assumes very low conversion (0.5–1%) from along‑street flows, implying that only a small fraction of relevant traffic naturally passes the door, so exposure is best scored low (criterion 4: 4.0). At the node level, office and mall density supports substantial coffee demand, but the report lists multiple strong chains (Starbucks, Tims, Luckin/Manner‑type outlets) within 400 m, indicating tight competition where a new entrant must fight for share, so competition balance is only mid‑band (criterion 5: 5.5). By contrast, flow stability is high: this is a mature inner‑city corridor with dense, long‑term residential, office, hotel and metro anchors and no sign of structural decline, justifying a high stability score (criterion 6: 8.0). Demographically, 64–67% of the population is 15–59 with a strong white‑collar presence and an established coffee culture evidenced by existing chains, although a 20% 65+ share slightly dilutes the fit; this still matches a “good to excellent” specialty‑coffee fit (criterion 7: 8.0). Combining these with the rubric weights yields a weighted score around 4.4, and because the combined morning + repeat sub‑scores average well under 6.0, the global cap limits the overall rating to the mid‑4s despite strong stability and demographic fit.

## Traffic & Accessibility: 4.6/10
The report describes a location with excellent macro connectivity but weak true commuter pass-by at the storefront. For A, the shop is inside a hotel, not on a main street corridor or mall spine, so only hotel guests, meeting attendees, and a small subset of external visitors pass within 0–30 m; this implies a weak 07:00–10:00 corridor (≈1,000–3,000 passers), consistent with a score of 3.0. For B, most key commuters (metro↔office, office↔home) are not naturally routed through the hotel: metro users have 5–7 minute total walks with only a subset willing to add 3–6 extra minutes, and many office workers from the southeast would face 8–14 extra minutes for a special trip, so overall detour fit is weak-to-moderate at 4.8. In contrast, C is strong (7.5): the area is rich in white-collar offices and dense residential, with clear morning/evening commuting peaks and explicit focus on weekday white-collar flows, so a substantial share of traffic is repeat commuters. D is moderate-strong at 6.0: Line 2 is a major trunk with very high volumes and the station is only ~350–450 m walking, but the analysis notes the store is slightly off the core desire lines, so only a fraction of total station flows can be realistically captured, triggering the rubric’s cap for limited natural capture. E is high at 8.0, as the report cites roughly 103,000 residents within 1 km plus 10,000–15,000 workers, placing the combined base firmly in “dense urban.” F is low at 2.0: captive population within the same building/complex is mostly 450–650 hotel guests plus staff and meeting attendees, likely under 1,000 daily captive users, and while access is frictionless for them, the rubric caps scores in this range. G is moderate at 6.0: within the hotel, potential 1F placement near lobby and elevator paths yields good visibility for hotel users and meeting traffic, but the unit is not on any broader mall or transit spine. H is excellent (9.0), as the report cites 2,500–3,500 parking spaces within 800 m including hotel/adjacent complexes and extremely convenient ride-hail drop-off at the hotel entrance. Weighting these and applying global caps driven by low A and sub-5 B yields an overall accessibility score of 4.6, reflecting strong macro transit and density but a fundamentally off-path, low-pass-by hotel placement for a commuter-focused coffee concept.

## Competition Analysis: 4.5/10
The report itself estimates a realistic coffee volume of roughly 230–330 cups/day for the proposed store, with most scenarios clustering near ~280–300 cups/day once the off-corridor hotel location and strong competition are considered. This places RSV clearly in the 250–349 band (“Weak”) and supports an Effective Node Volume score of 4.5: the wider node has substantial population and traffic, but the store’s micro-position inside a hotel and its acknowledged weakness for ‘顺路一杯’ significantly reduce effective 0–50 m passers. Saturation is explicitly described as very high: about 30 coffee-related outlets within 500 m, 18–20 within 300 m, and 3 within ~100 m, in a mature first-tier city cluster where supply ≈ demand and new entrants are expected to cannibalize existing volume, which fits a ‘Poor’ but not extreme saturation band at 4.0. Despite that, the analysis argues convincingly for a differentiated role as a hotel-integrated “third space” (coffee +简餐+办公+小酒馆+会议), especially for hotel guests and long-stay white-collar users underserved by fast commuter formats; this represents real but execution-dependent white space, warranting an Adequate Positioning White Space score of 6.0. Anchor risk is substantial: a Starbucks Reserve (hero unit) is ~31 m away, with Luckin, Manner, and other strong chains within 100–200 m on the same broader flows, and the report notes that high-value and commuter segments are largely pre-captured by these brands; this aligns with a Poor Anchor/Incumbent Risk score of 3.5. Combining these with the specified weights yields a final score of approximately 4.5, reflecting a commercially tough but not hopeless node where viable performance depends on strong differentiation rather than pure coffee throughput.
