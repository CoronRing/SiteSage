# Weighting Rationale

- **Store type:** Coffee Shop / Café in an urban Shanghai location (1111 Tianshan Road), likely surrounded by offices, residences, and other retail.
- **Traffic & Accessibility (0.39):**
  - Coffee shops depend heavily on daily, repeat visits and impulse/"on-the-way" purchases.
  - Ground-floor presence (Unit 101) and a second-floor space (Unit 201) make visibility, building access, and pedestrian flows especially important.
  - Proximity to transit, sidewalks, and building entrances will strongly influence utilization of both floors.
- **Customer (0.31):**
  - While coffee has broad appeal, success hinges on sufficient density of relevant users (office workers, nearby residents, students) with appropriate income and lifestyle.
  - Repeat behavior (morning coffee, afternoon breaks, casual meetings) makes understanding local routines and demographics important, though slightly less than pure traffic volume.
- **Competition (0.30):**
  - Shanghai’s coffee market is typically competitive, with chains and independents nearby.
  - Competitive pressure matters (pricing, brand mix, differentiation), but a strong, convenient location with adequate customer base can still perform well even in a competitive cluster.
  - Thus, competition is important but marginally less weighted than traffic/access and customer density.
