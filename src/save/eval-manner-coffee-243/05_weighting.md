# Weighting Rationale

- **Store type:** Coffee Shop / Café near Binjiang Skate Park in Shanghai
- **Business model:** Neighborhood and recreation-adjacent café serving a broad mix of local residents, skaters, and casual visitors; likely frequent, lower-ticket visits.

- **Customer (0.31)**
  - Broad appeal (coffee, drinks, light food) to many demographics; not a highly niche or membership-based concept.
  - Still important to size and understand key segments (skaters/park users, nearby residents, possible office workers) and their visit times and spending power.
  - Therefore, customer is important but not dominant, aligned with the 0.30–0.33 range for coffee shops.

- **Traffic & Accessibility (0.39)**
  - Critical driver: relies on steady foot traffic from the nearby riverside area, skate park, and surrounding streets.
  - Convenience and visibility from pedestrian flows and bike/last-mile access are essential for repeat daily visits and impulse stops.
  - Slightly above mid-range within the 0.35–0.40 guideline for coffee shops, reflecting the strong dependence on recreational and neighborhood traffic.

- **Competition (0.30)**
  - Shanghai’s coffee market is generally competitive, but the immediate micro-location near a skate park may offer some differentiation via lifestyle positioning and outdoor/recreation focus.
  - Competition remains meaningful but not more important than securing strong traffic and fit with local users.
  - Set at the lower end of the typical 0.30–0.35 coffee-shop competition range to reflect some differentiation potential from the park adjacency.
