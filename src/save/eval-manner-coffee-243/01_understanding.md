You plan to open a coffee shop at **上海斜土路街道瑞宁路243号（近滨江滑板公园）**, which geocodes to the POI **“疯狂动物城”** at **上海市徐汇区瑞宁路243号**.

This location sits near the **Huangpu River waterfront** in Xuhui District:
- To the **east**, it is close to the open riverfront promenade area.
- To the **north and northeast**, there is a large green belt including **前滩江滩公园/江滩公园一带** and related riverside park spaces.
- To the **west and southwest**, there are denser built-up blocks with **residential communities** and **office / institutional buildings**.
- To the **south along the river**, are cultural and recreational destinations such as **龙美术馆** and sports-oriented facilities (e.g. brands like adidas RUNBASE in the same riverside belt), which are within a short walking distance along the waterfront.

Overall, the spot is in a **riverside recreation and culture corridor** with nearby parks, museum, and mixed residential/office areas within walking distance, making it suitable for a coffee shop that can serve both local residents and visitors to the waterfront and nearby attractions.
