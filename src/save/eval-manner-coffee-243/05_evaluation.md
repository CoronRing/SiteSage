# Evaluation Scores

## Customer Analysis: 5.8/10
The report describes a mixed community–leisure waterfront node rather than a CBD commuter hub. For weekday repeat users, it estimates a stable base of roughly 250–460 cups/day from residents, schools and nearby commercial areas, which fits the 120–350‑cup ‘moderate repeat base’ band once you take the lower/midpoint of that range and recognise that many of those visits will be more leisure‑like than rigid commuter routines, hence a 6.3 rather than a higher score. Morning‑peak strength is clearly weak: the area is dominated by residents, schools and parks, not office‑tower commuters, so within a 3‑hour morning window realistic deterministic cups from repeat users are likely in the tens, placing it in the 30–100 cup band and justifying a 4.0. All‑day leisure volume is strong on weekends but more modest on a typical weekday; nonetheless, the riverside promenade, parks and cultural facilities should still provide steady irregular traffic, giving perhaps 30–100 incremental weekday cups and a mid‑band leisure score of 6.0. Storefront exposure is described as being close to the riverside path and skate park, suggesting many relevant flows naturally pass within sight, but with some dependence on exact micro‑placement; this supports a ‘good exposure’ band score of 7.8 rather than truly prime. Competition is noted as present along the waterfront but without evidence of severe oversupply, and the node’s total coffee demand (especially when including weekends) likely supports healthy volumes per operator, so a balanced 8.0 is reasonable. Flow stability is constrained by strong dependence on weather, seasons and leisure traffic, which fits a neutral/uncertain 6.0 rather than a ‘very stable’ score. Demographically, about 60% of locals are 15–59 with substantial student, family and white‑collar presence and an established urban coffee culture, implying 40–60% of reachable repeat users fit the specialty coffee target, hence a ‘good fit’ score of 8.0. Because the weighted average of criteria (1) and (2) is only around 5.0 and the morning‑peak score is below 5, global caps apply, keeping the overall customer‑potential score at 5.8 despite strong weekend leisure and decent exposure.

## Traffic & Accessibility: 3.2/10
For a weekday-morning, commuter-focused specialty coffee concept, this location scores weak overall despite good general footfall and leisure potential. The report repeatedly emphasizes that the store sits on a secondary community road and riverfront slow-traffic corridor, not on any major metro–office or home–station commuter spine; morning pass-by at the actual storefront is therefore likely low and largely destination/leisure-oriented (A≈2.5). Most metro users walk 10–20 minutes from stations via other access points to the river, and typical desire lines from residences to metro or offices do not naturally pass the unit; adding the store generally requires several extra minutes of detour except for a minority heading specifically to the riverfront, yielding weak path fit (B≈3.5). The documented demand pattern is afternoon/evening, weekend, and sport/leisure heavy, with the analysis itself stating it is unsuitable for a “写字楼上班族早高峰店,” so commuter share and peak-hour alignment are clearly low (C≈3.0). While there are multiple metro lines within 1–1.5 km and bus stops within 200–300 m, the distance and geometry mean only a small fraction of station flows is realistically capturable on foot, so macro transit capture is weak–moderate rather than strong (D≈4.0). Within 1 km there are about 45k residents plus several thousand workers/students, putting the combined base solidly in the medium-density band (E≈5.5). However, the store is not in or directly under a large office/hotel complex and there is no evidence of a sizeable captive upstairs population; any workers in nearby buildings must walk outside, so the captive base is minimal (F≈1.5). Visibility is very dependent on exact orientation: best case it faces the river path and catches leisure flows, but it is clearly not at a major transit, office lobby, or entrance node and sits in a “corridor mid-section,” so for commuter flows placement is weak (G≈4.0). By contrast, car access is excellent: the report cites roughly 10,000+ parking spaces in the broader district, with multiple lots within 300 m and straightforward 5–10 minute walks, which is very favorable for drivers and drop-off (H≈9.0). These factors together support a low overall commuter-focused traffic & accessibility score of 3.2, constrained by very limited morning pass-by, poor alignment with commuter paths, and a near-absence of captive office populations.

## Competition Analysis: 6.1/10
The analysis implies a realistic sustainable volume for a well-positioned, differentiated new store in the 300–500 cups/day range, with a clear risk floor of 200–300 cups/day if it is undifferentiated. That places RSV around the 350–450 band, which fits the rubric’s ‘Adequate’ tier, so the Effective Node Volume score is set at 5.5. Saturation is clearly high at the 1 km scale (30–35 coffee outlets; >40 including tea/dessert), but within the more relevant 0–300 m ring there are only 2 direct coffee competitors, and within 600 m roughly 12–13 coffee options, which aligns with the rubric’s ‘Good’ level for absolute counts and per-capita density; the report notes intense competition but also that most units appear viable, so Saturation is scored 7.5. On positioning, the report identifies several credible but execution-dependent white spaces (sport/“recovery” focus, community+parent–child, local-culture+view café) and quantifies that differentiation could raise the store from 200–300 to 300–500 cups/day, an uplift of roughly 100–200 cups/day; this corresponds to ‘Adequate’ white space (some, but not transformational), so it is scored 6.0. Anchor risk is non-trivial, with Manner, Starbucks, %Arabica, Unir, RE而意 and multiple chains in the 500–1,000 m ring and two direct neighbors (Birdie Cup at 68 m and Manner at 222 m), but there is no hero flagship within 25 m or any top-tier chain within 50 m on the same micro-flow; this fits more with ‘Good’ rather than ‘Poor’ risk, leading to a 7.5. Applying the rubric weights (65/15/10/10) yields a final composite score of approximately 6.1, reflecting a mid-tier node: solid volume potential but already in a competitive, largely saturated waterfront corridor where success depends heavily on sharp differentiation and execution.
