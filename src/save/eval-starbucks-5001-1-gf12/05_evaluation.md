# Evaluation Scores

## Customer Analysis: 8.0/10
Population and catchment merit around 8.5: the report documents ~16k residents within 500 m and 60k within 1 km, with a strong working-age base and clear integration into a busy sub-center node, matching a ‘strong neighborhood/sub-center’ profile. Demographic and spending fit score 7.5: the 15–59 segment is large and the area clearly consumes coffee, but the relatively high 60+ share and community‑commercial rather than pure white‑collar office mix mean the ideal coffee demographic is strong but not dominant. The core dimension—customer behavior and daypart—scores 8.0: the analysis is unusually granular on 7–11 a.m., breaking down commuters, mall staff, local workers, residents, and park users with explicit penetration and capture assumptions, yielding a coherent 125–280 cup/day baseline and a justified upper bound; however, the estimates lean on benchmarked footfall and assumed route shares rather than hard counts, and the unresolved question of corridor openness slightly weakens certainty. Opportunities and risks are rated 7.0: the mall’s ongoing upgrade and entrenched coffee culture are positives, but risks from mall-repositioning disruption, convenience‑store density, and dependence on micro‑flow placement are clearly identified, suggesting a net mildly positive but not risk‑free outlook. Weighted together, these sub-scores support an overall customer potential score of about 8.0/10.

## Traffic & Accessibility: 8.0/10
Public transit and connectivity quality justifies an 8.5: the report describes a major two-line metro hub (Line 1 and 5) with ‘ten‑thousand‑level’ daily flows and 30–40k morning-peak passengers, plus several nearby bus stops; distances of 300–350 m to station exits and 140–150 m to key bus stops fit squarely within the ‘strong multi-line or regional node’ band. Walkability, parking, and road access score 8.0: sidewalks and links between metro, parks, residences, and mall are continuous, and there are 1,000–1,500 spaces on-site and 2,000+ within 400 m, with typical walks of 1–4 minutes and no major access obstacles, though visibility relies on going inside the mall rather than true high‑street exposure. Target-customer mobility fit also rates 8.0: detour analysis shows most metro commuters to nearby homes, schools, or buses can include the store with ≤5 minutes and often 1–2 minutes of extra walking, while employees face near‑zero incremental detour; the only caveat, correctly noted, is dependence on which early-morning entrances and corridors are open, triggering some uncertainty and capping the score below ‘excellent’. Traffic volume and temporal benefits are at 7.8: the analysis estimates 3,800–6,000 people within a 5-minute detour and 7,000–12,000 within 10 minutes during the morning peak and ties that to a realistic 150–280 cup target, but it concedes that the shop is not street-facing and that actual pass-by depends on being on an open main spine, which slightly reduces confidence versus a guaranteed concourse-front unit. Taken together, these weighted sub-scores support an overall traffic and accessibility score of about 8.0/10.

## Competition Analysis: 4.9/10
Competitor density and micro-proximity deserve a low 3.0: within 0–120 m there are at least four branded chain coffee shops (M Stand, Starbucks Reserve, another Starbucks, mid-distance Luckin), plus 6–7 bakery cafes that also serve coffee, all in the same mall environment; this matches the rubric’s interior-mall hyper-cluster condition of four or more chain coffee units plus several bakery/dessert cafes within 150 m, which calls for density scores ≤3.5. Market saturation versus demand scores 5.5, reflecting rough balance: the report tallies about 25–30 coffee‑led outlets and 80–100 total coffee/breakfast selling points within 1 km, yet shows that potential early-peak coffee consumers of 3,500–6,200 could sustain 150–250 cups per store; this implies a tightly balanced, not clearly over-supplied market where new entrants must take share. Positioning opportunity is rated 5.5: the analysis proposes credible differentiation around early-morning speed, mid-range ‘精品不贵’ pricing, and coffee‑centric light breakfast and relationship marketing, but major niches (premium sit-down, lifestyle specialty, value digital coffee, ultra‑convenient convenience-store coffee) are already strongly held, so white space is limited and success hinges more on execution than structural gaps; the rubric suggests a downward tilt in a clustered mall versus a looser street node, keeping this in the adequate band. Competitive risk scores 4.0 given the presence, within ~50 m, of M Stand and Starbucks Reserve as powerful incumbents on the same flows, plus two Luckins and dense convenience channels nearby; this aligns with the rubric’s guidance that when hero units sit in the same project with multiple substitutes, risk should be in the ‘poor’ range. Weighted at 20%, 30%, 25%, and 25%, these subscores yield a composite competition favorability of roughly 4.9/10, indicating a challenging but not impossible environment for a well-differentiated entrant.
