The planned boutique coffee shop is located inside Jing’an Kerry Centre at 上海市静安区南京西路1515号嘉里中心商场E1-03, in Shanghai’s Jing’an District. Geocoding places it within the core Jing’an Temple commercial zone along Nanjing West Road.

- The point **A** on the static map sits inside the Jing’an Kerry Centre commercial complex, in a dense, high-end mixed-use environment.
- **North** of the point are further sections of Jing’an Kerry Centre (often referred to as the north mall) and additional commercial buildings.
- **South** lies more of the Kerry Centre mall area extending toward Nanjing West Road, with continuous retail frontage.
- To the **west**, within a short walking distance, are Jing’an Temple Metro Station (a major interchange) and Jing’an Temple itself, surrounded by intensive retail such as MUJI and other branded stores.
- To the **east**, the corridor continues as a major office and retail strip with office towers and shopping facilities, forming part of the Nanjing West Road commercial belt.

This places the site in a prime urban commercial core, surrounded by shopping malls, offices, and cultural/tourism destinations, with strong pedestrian flows and excellent metro and bus accessibility—conditions that align well with a morning-commuter-oriented boutique coffee concept.
