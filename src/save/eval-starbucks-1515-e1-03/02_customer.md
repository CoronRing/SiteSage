## 1. Store & Location Summary  

**Store type & positioning**

- Boutique coffee shop, **medium–premium price**, focus on:
  - **Morning commuters**
  - Office workers in and around Jing’an Kerry Centre
  - Mall visitors using the complex as an interchange / pass-through
- Service mode: **dine-in + takeaway**, optimized for **early–late morning peak**.

**Location**

- Address: 上海市静安区南京西路1515号静安嘉里中心商场E1-03  
- Inside **Jing’an Kerry Centre** (静安嘉里中心) – a large mixed-use complex (office, mall, hotel, serviced apartments) on **West Nanjing Road** in **Jing’an Temple commercial zone**.
- ~150–250 m walking distance to **Jing’an Temple Metro Station** (interchange for lines 2, 7, 14).
- Surrounding context within ~500–800 m:
  - Multiple Class A office towers
  - High-end malls (静安嘉里中心多区, 久光百货, 恒隆广场, 上海商城等)
  - 4–5 star hotels (Shangri-La, Swissôtel, Portman Ritz-Carlton, Hilton/明东方等)
  - Dense bus stops and elevated bus corridors.

For a boutique commuter coffee shop in a transit/office core, the **effective morning catchment** is best thought of in **300 m / 500 m / 1000 m** radii, combining resident + mobile (commuters, office staff, hotel guests, shoppers).

## 2. Demographics Around the Site

WorldPop residential population estimates (note: **only residents**, not commuters/office users):

| Radius from store | Total pop. | 0–14 yrs | 15–59 yrs | 60–64 yrs | 65+ yrs |
|-------------------|-----------:|---------:|----------:|----------:|--------:|
| **300 m**         | 4,991      | 348 (7.0%) | 2,934 (58.8%) | 453 (9.1%) | 1,270 (25.4%) |
| **500 m**         | 14,129     | 1,028 (7.3%) | 8,208 (58.1%) | 1,342 (9.5%) | 3,673 (26.0%) |
| **1000 m**        | 67,724     | 5,566 (8.2%) | 39,523 (58.4%) | 6,188 (9.1%) | 17,277 (25.5%) |

**Implications for coffee demand**

- Within **500 m**, about **8,200 residents in working age (15–59)**.
- Within **1000 m**, about **39,500 residents in working age**.
- However, this is a **prime office and transit hub**, so **daytime/mobile population will be several times higher** than residents alone, especially 15–59 yrs (office workers and commuters).

## 4. Footfall & Traffic Benchmarks

### 4.1 Jing’an Kerry Centre (Mall + Mixed Use)

Public sources for exact daily visitor counts are limited, but we can infer from:

- Size: ~4.8 million sq ft (~445,900 m²) total GFA across mall, offices, hotel, residences.
- Function: prime integrated mall + Grade A offices + 508-room Shangri-La + serviced apartments.
- Comparable Shanghai high-end malls (e.g., Plaza 66, Taikoo Hui) often report:
  - **Weekday daily visitors**: ~40,000–80,000  
  - **Weekend/holiday**: ~80,000–150,000  

**Conservative working assumption for Jing’an Kerry Centre overall daily footfall** (all-day, all uses):

- **Weekday average**:  
  - Mall retail visitors: **30,000–40,000/day**  
  - Office workers (in-tower population): **10,000–15,000 persons**  
  - Hotel + serviced apartments + residents circulation: **2,000–4,000 persons**  
  - **Total presence in/through complex** (duplicates not fully netted out): **≈45,000–55,000 people/day**  

For **morning peak (roughly 7:30–10:30)**, it is reasonable to assume about **35–45%** of total daily office/commute-related movement happens in that window:

- Office/commuter-related flows in the complex during morning peak:
  - Roughly **10,000–15,000 entries** (arrivals plus some internal movements).

A boutique coffee shop in a **mall corridor facing main commuter paths** will be exposed to only a **portion** of this, depending on exact vertical circulation (escalators, exits). A conservative **corridor exposure** assumption:

- **25–40%** of those commuters **pass near the unit** in the relevant time window.
  - That yields **2,500–6,000 potential morning passers-by** from **Kerry Centre internal users alone**.

### 4.2 Jing’an Temple Metro Station

While the search result did not give a numeric passenger count directly, we can approximate from:

- It is a **triple-line interchange (2, 7, 14)** in a central CBD.
- Comparable Shanghai interchange stations (non-terminal) with 2–3 lines typically handle:
  - **200,000–400,000 passenger entries+exits/day**.

Conservative assumption for **Jing’an Temple Station**:

- **Daily entries+exits**: **≈250,000–300,000**  
- **Morning peak share (7:00–10:00)**: ~35–40% of daily:
  - **≈90,000–120,000 passenger movements in the morning window** (entries+exits+transfers).  

Only a **fraction** of those will move through Jing’an Kerry Centre or its immediate sidewalks:

- Assume **20–30%** of morning peak passengers exit/enter on the Kerry-centre-facing side or walk along Nanjing West Road by the complex:
  - That is roughly **18,000–36,000 morning-passers within 300–400 m** of the store.
- Of those, only a subset will come inside the mall and near this specific unit; assume:
  - **15–30%** penetrate into Kerry Centre or use it as a pass-through:
    - ≈ **2,700–10,800 potential additional morning passers** linked to the station flows.

To avoid double counting, some of these flows overlap with Kerry Centre office workers already included above; we treat metro-driven passers as **incremental but partially overlapping**.

---

## 5. Main Customer Sources

### 5.1 Deterministic Baseline Customer Groups

These are groups with relatively stable, predictable presence:

1. **Office workers in Jing’an Kerry Centre towers**
   - Office worker population estimate: **10,000–15,000 employees**.
   - Assume:
     - 80–90% come on-site on a typical weekday: **8,000–13,500**.
     - 60–70% arrive in the **7:30–10:00** window: **≈4,800–9,450** persons.
   - Share that **walk near the unit** (depending on layout, escalator proximity):
     - Assume **40–60%**: **≈1,900–5,700 commuters** reliably pass close to the store on a **typical weekday morning**.

2. **Hotel guests (Shangri-La + adjacent hotels within 300 m that use Kerry Centre paths)**
   - Jing’an Shangri-La: **≈508 rooms**, assume 80% occupancy → **≈400 occupied rooms**.
   - Average 1.5 guests/room: **≈600 guests/night**.
   - Morning coffee demand segment:
     - Assume 40–50% go out or pass through mall in the **morning**: **≈240–300** potential coffee seekers.
   - Realistic share that pass the specific coffee shop: maybe **30–50%** → **≈70–150 morning passers** from Shangri-La alone.
   - Adding nearby serviced apartments/hotels that link through mall paths (e.g., 嘉里公寓, partial Swissôtel & others) we can reasonably get to:
     - **≈150–300 stable hotel-related morning passers** near the shop.

3. **Mall employees (retail & service staff)**  
   - A large mall of this size can host easily **300–600 F&B/retail/service staff** per shift.
   - Morning-shift staff arriving 8:00–10:00:
     - Assume **200–400** people/day entering via staff/employee or public paths.
   - Fraction using this corridor: say **50–70%**:
     - **≈100–280 deterministic morning passers**.

**Deterministic minimum daily morning passer volume near the store (weekday)**  
Add the conservative lower bounds:

- Office workers near unit: **≈1,900**
- Hotel-related: **≈150**
- Mall staff: **≈100**

→ **≈2,150 deterministic morning passers per weekday** regularly exposed to the shop frontage.  

Using mid-high estimates:

- Office: ≈**5,700**
- Hotels: ≈**300**
- Staff: ≈**280**

→ **≈6,300 deterministic morning passers per weekday**.

### 5.2 Additional / Potential Customer Groups

Less predictable or more variable, but large in volume:

1. **Metro-driven commuters not working in Kerry Centre**
   - Earlier we estimated **≈2,700–10,800** potential morning passers from metro users who:
     - Exit at Jing’an Temple
     - Walk along Nanjing West Road
     - Enter Kerry Centre as a walkway / for breakfast.
   - To avoid overlap with Kerry’s own office workers:
     - Treat **≈2,000–6,000** as **distinct additional potential passers** in the **morning peak**, especially on rainy/cold days when indoor paths are preferred.

2. **Office workers in nearby non-Kerry buildings (Plaza 66, Shanghai Centre, CP Jingan, Taikoo Hui, etc.)**
   - Combined nearby CBD within **500–800 m** likely hosts **tens of thousands of office employees**.
   - Only a small share will **walk through Kerry Centre or past its entrances** in the morning.
   - Reasonable incremental near-store passer estimate:
     - **≈500–1,500** morning passers from neighboring offices using Nanjing West Road corridor and dipping into Kerry Centre for breakfast/coffee or cut-through.

3. **Residents within walking distance**
   - Within **500 m radius**, **≈14,129 residents**, with **≈8,208 working age**.
   - Of those, perhaps:
     - 20–30% have white-collar/office roles nearby or commute via Jing’an Temple: **≈1,600–2,500 people**.
     - Only a fraction will choose this coffee shop as their morning routine.
   - Conservatively, assume:
     - **≈150–300 regular resident commuters** could walk by the shop in the morning.

4. **Tourists & temple visitors (non-business travelers)**
   - Jing’an Temple itself is a **cultural/heritage attraction** with tourist flows that start late morning / midday.
   - Impact on **strict “morning commuter” window** is modest:
     - Maybe **50–150** extra passers in morning peak on weekdays.
     - Larger on weekends, but still less commuter-centric.

## 6. Customer Number Estimation for the Coffee Shop

Here we translate **passer flows** into **potential buyers**.

### 6.1 Estimating Exposed Footfall (Morning Peak, Weekday)

Combining sources while controlling for overlap:

- **Deterministic corridor passers (mainly within Kerry Centre & attached hotels/staff)**:  
  - **≈2,150–6,300 people**.
- **Additional potential passers**:
  - Non-Kerry office commuters using Nanjing West Rd & Kerry paths: **≈500–1,500**
  - Extra metro commuters not working in Kerry, but using the corridor: **≈2,000–6,000**
  - Residents & tourists: **≈200–450**

To avoid over-counting, let’s tighten the combined exposure estimate:

- **Conservative lower bound exposed near-store footfall (7:30–10:30 weekday)**:
  - ≈ **4,500 people**
- **Likely midcase**:
  - ≈ **7,000–9,000 people**
- **Upper but still realistic bound** (rainy/cold days, good routing position):
  - ≈ **11,000–12,000 people**

These numbers represent **people walking past or very near the store frontage** during morning peak.

### 6.2 Conversion to Coffee Customers

For a **boutique medium–premium coffee shop** in a **CBD mall**, typical **morning peak capture rate** (passers → buyers) might be:

- **Low (competitive / poor visibility)**: 2–3%
- **Moderate (good visibility, strong product, some loyalty)**: 4–7%
- **High (prime line-of-flow, strong brand, good operations)**: 8–10% of relevant passers.

Using the **exposed footfall ranges**:

**Deterministic minimum scenario (4,500 passers, 3–4% conversion):**

- Customers in morning peak:
  - 4,500 × 3% = **135**
  - 4,500 × 4% = **180**
- This can be seen as a **deterministic base range** if execution is competent.

**Likely scenario (7,000–9,000 passers, 4–7% conversion):**

- Lower mid: 7,000 × 4% = **280**
- Upper mid: 9,000 × 7% = **630**
- So **≈280–630 morning customers** on a typical weekday is a reasonable **working expectation**.

**Potential (maximum realistic) scenario (11,000–12,000 passers, 8–10% conversion):**

- 11,000 × 8% = **880**
- 12,000 × 10% = **1,200**
- This **880–1,200 range** would reflect:
  - Highly optimized product & operations
  - Strong brand magnetism
  - Excellent queue handling and pre-order/digital channels
  - Prime exact placement on key flows.

### 6.3 Summary of Customer Number Estimation

**Morning peak (weekday, 7:30–10:30) – per day**

- **Deterministic customer number (realistic minimum)**:  
  - **≈130–180 coffee transactions**
- **Likely working range (if well executed)**:  
  - **≈280–630 coffee transactions**
- **Potential maximum (optimistic but still grounded)**:  
  - **≈880–1,200 coffee transactions**

Note:  
- These are **transactions**, not unique people (some may buy 2 drinks).  
- If average morning ticket is **1.2–1.4 drinks per transaction**, actual **drink volume** could be **~1.2× these numbers**.

## 7. Pros & Cons of This Location (Customer Potential)

### Pros

- **High nearby working-age population**:
  - Within 1000 m, **≈39,500 residents aged 15–59**, plus a very large **daytime office population**.
- **Direct integration with a major mixed-use complex**:
  - In-building access to **10,000–15,000 office workers**, **500+ hotel rooms**, mall staff, and residents.
- **Adjacent to a major triple-line metro interchange**:
  - Jing’an Temple Station estimated **≈250,000–300,000** daily passengers; **≈90,000–120,000** in morning peak alone.
- **Strong hotel & expat/business traveler base**:
  - Multiple **4–5 star hotels and serviced apartments** within **300–400 m**, ~1,500+ rooms in total across properties; many guests are **high coffee spenders**.
- **Morning-focus fits local rhythm**:
  - Heavy **office arrival** wave 8:00–9:30; many workers prefer takeaway specialty coffee.
- **Price level (medium–premium)** is aligned with:
  - Local **income level** in Jing’an CBD
  - Expectations of business travelers and white-collar workers.

### Cons / Risks

- **Intense competition**:
  - High likelihood of multiple international chains and specialty coffee brands **within the same mall and 300–500 m radius**.
  - This will **push down capture rates** unless differentiation is strong.
- **Mall interior positioning is critical**:
  - If the unit is not on the **main commuter path** (from metro exits/office tower lobbies/escalators), actual passing volume could drop significantly below the 7,000–9,000 midcase; may fall closer to **3,000–4,000**, cutting potential customers by half.
- **Dependence on weekday office traffic**:
  - A large part of the model relies on office workers; changes in **WFH policies** or **economic cycles** can reduce deterministic flows.
- **Limited resident-driven breakfast business**:
  - While residents are present, many local high-income residents may **eat breakfast at home or on other routes**, meaning **resident contribution to morning volume is modest** relative to office/metro contributions.
- **Mall entry and opening hours**:
  - If key mall entrances/sections open later than 8:00, earliest commuter segment (7:00–8:00) may be partially lost.

---

## 8. Conclusion

- Considering **residential demographics**, **office & hotel density**, and **metro footfall**, this unit in **Jing’an Kerry Centre** has **strong quantitative customer potential in the morning commuter window**.
- A **realistic planning assumption** for a well-positioned, well-executed boutique coffee shop here would be:
  - **Deterministic base**: ~**130–180** morning transactions
  - **Operational target range**: ~**300–600** morning transactions on weekdays
  - **Upper potential** (if location is directly in main flow + strong brand): **≈900–1,200** transactions in peak morning.

Achieving closer to the upper range will depend heavily on:

1. Exact micro-location (visibility from key entrances/escalators & office lobbies).  
2. Speed of service and throughput in peak **1–1.5 hours**.  
3. Brand recognition, digital pre-order, and loyalty among Kerry office tenants and metro commuters.
