# Evaluation Scores

## Customer Analysis: 8.6/10
Population and catchment strength merit around 9.2: within 1 km there are ~67k residents (≈39.5k working-age) plus very large office, hotel, and transit-driven daytime populations centered on a triple-line interchange and a major mixed-use complex, matching the rubric’s “strong district hub / near city-level hub” description. Demographic and spending fit scores about 9.0, as the report clearly targets office workers, commuters, and business travelers in a prime Jing’an CBD area where medium–premium coffee is already well accepted and supported by high-end hotels and malls. Customer behavior and daypart alignment is the core of the analysis and is strong, warranting about 8.5: the report quantifies morning flows (deterministic 2,150–6,300 near-store passers, total 4,500–12,000) and translates them into realistic conversion bands (≈130–180 minimum, 280–630 likely, 880–1,200 optimistic), tightly aligned with the 7:30–10:30 commuter window, while recognizing corridor positioning sensitivities; this sits in the “excellent to good” band but not perfect because micro-location uncertainties could materially cut realized flows. Opportunities and risks are addressed but more qualitatively, so about 7.0: competition intensity, dependence on office traffic, and opening-hour constraints are identified, but downside scenarios to the customer estimates are not fully modeled. Weighted by the rubric (10%, 10%, 70%, 10%), these sub-scores give an overall customer potential score of roughly 8.6, reflecting a very strong but execution-sensitive commuter-focused opportunity.

## Traffic & Accessibility: 8.5/10
Public transit and connectivity quality is clearly in the top tier at about 9.5: the site is tied to a three-line interchange (2/7/14) with hundreds of thousands of daily passengers and exits within 150–300 m feeding directly into Jing’an Kerry Centre, matching the rubric’s “top-tier city transit hub, directly integrated” profile. Walkability, parking, and road access score around 8.5: sidewalks and desire lines are strong and largely weather-protected, and there is abundant underground parking within 30–200 m with simple vertical circulation, though the store itself is interior and not directly visible from arterial roads. Target customer mobility fit is about 8.0: for core segments (Kerry office workers, mall staff, Kerry parkers) the extra detour is typically ≤3 minutes and often ≈0–2, fitting the “excellent/good” definitions, but for many non-Kerry commuters and nearby office workers detours can reach 5–8 minutes, justifying a slight reduction and avoiding the highest band. Traffic volume and temporal benefits are strong at roughly 8.3: the report provides reasoned estimates that 4,500–12,000 people traverse within 0–30 m of the storefront in the 7:30–10:30 window, with a central estimate of 7,000–9,000, and maps these flows to specific desire lines; uncertainty around exact corridor prominence prevents a 9+ rating. Applying the rubric weights (20%, 10%, 10%, 60%) yields an overall traffic and accessibility score near 8.5, reflecting excellent macro-transit access and strong but micro-location-sensitive storefront traffic in the key morning commuter window.

## Competition Analysis: 4.7/10
Competitor density and micro-proximity warrant a low score around 3.0: within 400 m there are 40–45 coffee-led venues and within 200 m about 18–22, including multiple branded chains inside the same mall (Starbucks Reserve as a flagship hero unit, Blue Bottle, nodi, Birdie Cup, LB, Ralph’s, Manner, etc.), fitting the rubric’s interior-mall hyper-cluster rule (≥4 chain coffee units plus several cafe/bakery-style competitors within ~150 m) and justifying a density rating ≤3.5. Market saturation versus demand is roughly balanced at 5.0: the analysis estimates a morning peak potential of about 1,050–4,000 cups spread across ~40 cafes in 400 m, indicating a high-density environment where per-store volumes are viable but not obviously above network norms; new entrants must mainly take share rather than fill unmet demand. Positioning opportunity scores about 6.5: despite heavy clustering, the report identifies a mid-priced specialty niche (better coffee than Manner/Luckin, cheaper and faster than Blue Bottle/Ralph’s) and a strong early-morning/throughput focus, offering limited but real differentiation consistent with an “adequate” band tilted toward the upper side. Competitive risk is high, around 3.5: several strong incumbents, including a Starbucks Reserve unit in essentially the same micro-zone and other powerful brands within 50–200 m, will likely defend via brand loyalty, coupons, and corporate agreements, matching the rubric’s description of “high competitive risk” in hyper-dense interior malls. Weighting these sub-scores (20%, 30%, 25%, 25%) gives an overall competition score near 4.7, reflecting a structurally attractive demand node but a heavily saturated, high-risk competitive environment where only sharp positioning and execution can secure sustainable share.
