## 1. Public transit availability

### 1.1 Metro (core driver)

Nearest facilities within ~600 m:

- **Jing’an Temple Station 静安寺站（lines 2 / 7 / 14）**
  - Main station centroid: ~357 m from store (straight-line; ~450–500 m walking indoors + street).
  - Key exits around the store:
    - Exit 6: 155 m
    - Exits 8 & 9: 247–268 m
    - Station main: 357 m
    - Multiple other exits 2/3/4/5/10/1/11/13B/14 within 245–575 m
  - Typical walk time from relevant exits:
    - **Best exits (6/8/9)**: 2–4 min to store (150–280 m).
    - Farthest exits (1/11/13B/14): 6–8 min (450–550 m), usually not chosen by Kerry commuters.

Given local geometry and indoor connectivity:

- **Effective metro–store distance for office commuters using Jing’an Kerry**:  
  ~200–350 m, or 3–6 min including escalators and internal corridors.

Lines coverage:

- **Line 2**: Cross-city east–west backbone (浦东机场–虹桥机场/火车站), directly feeding:
  - Long-distance airport/rail commuters
  - White-collar residents from large bedroom communities along the line
- **Line 7**: North–south, linking Putuo, Changning, Pudong
- **Line 14**: High-capacity east–west, relieving line 2; strong CBD–residential linkage

Daily station scale (public data, rounded):

- 静安寺站 daily entries/exits: widely estimated in **hundreds of thousands**; morning peak 7:00–10:00 commonly exceeds **40,000–60,000 passenger movements**.
- From previous customer analysis:
  - Office+hotel+mall-related *visible* flows in Kerry alone in the morning:  
    **4,500 – 12,000 people / workday (7:30–10:30)** passing near store.

**Transit implication:**  
The shop is effectively plugged into one of Shanghai’s highest‑throughput, 3‑line interchange stations, with < 5 min connection for most Kerry-bound commuters.

### 1.2 Bus & BRT / express bus

Nearby bus-related POIs (distance from store):

- 延安中路铜仁路（公交站） – 261 m
- 铜仁路南京西路（公交站） – 291 m
- 上海展览中心（快速公交站） – 322 m
- 常德路（快速公交站） – 347 m
- 南京西路陕西北路（公交站） – 463 m
- 延安中路陕西北路（公交站） – 538 m
- 静安寺（公交站） – 583 m

Characteristics:

- Multiple conventional bus stops along 南京西路 / 延安中路 supporting short/medium-distance commuting.
- 2 rapid/express bus stops (上海展览中心、常德路) within **350 m**, reinforcing commuter flows parallel to the metro.

Role for the coffee shop:

- Bus riders constitute an additional **short‑walk** commuting segment.
- Realistically, compared with metro:
  - Metro likely delivers **>70–80%** of public-transit commuter base.
  - Bus nodes give incremental traffic, especially from people alighting closer to Kerry than to the metro entrance.

## 2. Parking availability

Tool results show a **dense cluster of parking options**. Within 250 m:

- **Jing’an Kerry Centre underground parking (core supply)**
  - 静安嘉里中心东区商场地下停车场（公共） – 28 m
  - 办公楼 1 座地下停车场（公共） – 34 m
  - 多个出入口 at 28–93 m
  - South area (南区) underground parking – 85–162 m
  - Combined, Kerry provides **large-capacity, multi-entrance underground parking**, servicing:
    - Office towers
    - Retail podium
    - Shangri-La hotel
- **Other structured parking within 250 m**
  - 中欣大厦立体停车场 – ~140–175 m
  - 九安广场银座停车场 – ~212 m
  - 88 铜仁路酒店停车场 – ~211–215 m
  - 上海展览中心停车场（内部/公共出入口） – ~208–240 m
- **Nearby mall/hotel parking**
  - 巴黎春天/久光百货/越洋广场等地下停车场 – 240–260 m range

Practical interpretation:

- For **office workers driving to Kerry**:
  - They park directly underneath the complex; vertical circulation (lifts/escalators) brings them into podium levels that feed the coffee shop’s corridor.
  - Horizontal distance from main parking cores to shop: **~50–220 m**, or **2–5 min** via internal routes.
- For **hotel guests (Shangri-La, 88 铜仁路, Portman, etc.)**:
  - Hotel parking connects by short outdoor or partially covered walks (120–260 m), adding to breakfast/coffee demand.

## 3. Customer flow analysis (morning peak)

### 3.1 Key desire lines (see map)

Static map:  

![Map](https://restapi.amap.com/v3/staticmap?location=121.450056%2C31.224335&zoom=16&size=512%2A512&markers=mid%2C%2CA%3A121.450056%2C31.224335%7Cmid%2C%2CM%3A121.446533%2C31.223231%7Cmid%2C%2CP%3A121.449482%2C31.222281%7Cmid%2C%2CO%3A121.449969%2C31.225591&styles=default)

- **A – Store (嘉里中心 E1‑03)**  
- **M – 静安寺地铁站** (3‑line interchange)  
- **P – Kerry main parking access (南区方向)**  
- **O – Nearby Grade A office tower (north across 延安中路)**  

**Main morning flows (7:30–10:30):**

1. **Metro → Kerry office towers / podium (M → A → Offices)**
   - Commuters exit line 2/7/14, follow:
     - Underground corridors and mall connections, or  
     - Sidewalk on 南京西路, then into Kerry podium.
   - A well-placed coffee shop on level 1 near an internal axis can intercept:
     - People going from **M → Kerry lifts**.
     - People cutting across podium from southwest (metro) to north/east tower lobbies.

2. **Metro → Northern office belt (M → O and other towers)**
   - Workers from metro walking east/northeast, then crossing 延安中路 to reach:
     - Plaza 66, CITIC Square, HKRI Taikoo Hui, etc.
   - Part of this group cuts through or skirts Kerry to avoid congestion or inclement weather, especially in winter/rainy days.  
   - Coffee shop can capture:
     - A portion **before** they cross 延安中路, especially if positioned on a “straight-through” line inside Kerry.

3. **Parking → Offices / Mall (P → A → Offices/Retail)**
   - Drivers park under Kerry, ascend to podium, and walk through:
     - **Northbound** to towers and retail.
   - A on‑axis coffee shop becomes “first stop” for car commuters; this audience tends to have:
     - Higher average ticket (add pastry/food)
     - Strong repeat patterns (fixed routes, fixed time windows).

4. **Nearby office towers / hotels → Kerry amenities (O → A)**
   - White‑collar and hotel guests from the north walk across 延安中路 to:
     - Use Kerry’s F&B as their “canteen”.
   - Morning pattern:
     - **Coffee grab on the way from home/parking/metro** into office.
     - **2nd coffee run** 9:30–11:00 from offices to Kerry.

### 3.2 Volumetric perspective (tying to previous analysis)

From previous customer analysis (for 7:30–10:30 on working days):

- **Kerry office population**: ~10,000–15,000
  - Estimated passing directly near store: **1,900–5,700 people**
- **Hotels & serviced apartments** (Shangri-La + others): **150–300 people**
- **Mall employees**: **100–280 people**
- Combined “predictable corridor” traffic through Kerry:  
  **2,150–6,300 people / morning peak**

Calibrated with metro, bus and surrounding offices, consolidated:

- **Visible store‑front flows**:  
  - Lower estimate: ~4,500 / morning  
  - Central estimate: **7,000–9,000 / morning**  
  - Upper bound: **11,000–12,000 / morning**

For target segments:

- **Morning commuters & office workers**:
  - Likely **>80%** of peak traffic near shop.
- **Mall-as-hub users & hotel guests**:
  - **10–20%** of peak traffic near shop, but higher per‑capita spend.

## 4. Detour estimation & catchment (5 / 10‑minute detours)

### 4.1 Geometry of detours

Using the map analysis:

- **A ↔ M (metro)**: ~200–350 m practical walking via main routes → **3–6 min**.
- **A ↔ P (parking)**: 250–350 m including vertical circulation → **3–5 min**.
- **A ↔ O (north offices)**: 400–600 m including road crossing → **5–8 min**.

Define **detour** as *extra walking time beyond a straight origin–destination path*.

#### 1) Metro commuter whose final destination is a Kerry office tower

Baseline path: M → tower lobby via shortest indoor route.  
If the shop lies **on or next to** this line:

- **Extra detour:**
  - If directly on main concourse: ≤ 1 min (0–50 m deviation).
  - If slightly off but still level 1: 1–3 min (50–150 m one‑way).
- **5‑min detour radius:**
  - Includes essentially **all office workers in Kerry towers** and mall employees using the podium.
- **10‑min detour radius:**
  - Includes:
    - Most commuters exiting 静安寺站 whose offices are within **0–600 m** of Kerry in any direction (Plaza 66, Shanghai Centre, CITIC Square, etc.)  
    - Many will find the coffee-only detour of 6–8 min borderline, but a sizeable subsegment will accept it if product is differentiated (specialty coffee).

#### 2) Car commuters parking in Kerry

Baseline path: P → office lobby.

- If shop is on a corridor that must be crossed:
  - **Extra detour ≈ 0–2 min** (small step aside).
- If shop is off the main axis:
  - **Extra detour ≈ 3–5 min** maximum.

Given driving customers’ higher tolerance for minor time deviations, **5‑min detour zone essentially equals all Kerry parking users plus a fraction of adjacent car parks (中欣大厦, 九安广场, 88 铜仁路, etc.)**.

#### 3) Northern offices (O and belt) commuters from metro

Baseline path: Metro → cross 延安中路 → office tower.

- If they choose to cut through Kerry:
  - Passing by the shop can be almost **zero detour** (through‑traffic).
- If they approach along street and divert into Kerry:
  - **Extra detour 4–8 min** depending on exact path.
  - This group contributes less predictable traffic but adds to upside.

### 4.2 How many people fit within 5‑min / 10‑min detour

Based on previous quantitative work and transport geometry:

**Within ~5‑minute detour window** (roughly extra 300–350 m on top of baseline path):

- Includes:
  - Nearly all **office workers in Jing’an Kerry towers (~10,000–15,000)**.
  - **Mall staff (~100–280)**.
  - Car commuters parked in Kerry (~2,000+ spaces, actual commuter users several thousand).
  - A significant fraction of **hotel guests** whose paths cross podium.
- From the “predictable” morning corridor base (2,150–6,300):
  - Almost **100%** sit within a 5‑min detour tolerance (they already walk past or near).

**Within ~10‑minute detour window** (additional 600–700 m):

- Adds:
  - A share of white‑collars from Plaza 66, CITIC Square, Shanghai Centre, HKRI Taikoo Hui and surrounding towers.
  - A fraction of metro passengers whose offices lie further but still use Nanjing West Road as their walking spine.
- Considering:
  - 静安寺站 morning passenger throughput 40,000–60,000
  - Local office employment within ~800 m easily **tens of thousands**  
- Realistic **10‑minute detour‑tolerant population in the morning peak**:
  - **Low case**: 6,000–8,000 people
  - **Mid case**: **10,000–15,000 people**
  - **High case** (including more distant offices and partial tourists): 18,000–20,000+

This aligns with prior capture-rate-based demand estimates.

## 5. Visibility analysis

### 5.1 Macro visibility

- **Road context:**  
  - Jing’an Kerry fronts **南京西路** at the junction area with **静安寺 / 延安中路高架**—one of the **highest traffic crossroads** in Puxi.
  - Car and bus passenger visibility:
    - Store is **inside** the mall; external signboards and pylon signage can signal “coffee near metro exit”, but the shopfront itself is not seen directly from the main arterial.
- **Metro visibility:**
  - Depending on lease line:
    - If close to a **main internal spine** leading from metro‑connected hall to offices, visibility to **thousands per hour** in peak is possible.

### 5.2 In-mall visibility (critical here)

Because the shop is **inside Jing’an Kerry Centre**, visibility is governed by **pedestrian routing**, not by road traffic:

- Strong visibility scenarios:
  - On level 1 along the **shortest path** between:
    - Main south entry / metro-connected side and  
    - Office tower lobbies or escalators.
  - Near vertical circulation cores (escalators/elevators) used by commuters.
- Weaker visibility scenarios:
  - Deep in a side atrium or cul‑de‑sac **off the primary routes**.
  - On a level where commuters do not naturally pass (e.g., upper-level boutique corner).

Without exact unit positioning, using your previous estimation and map analysis:

- If E1‑03 is a **1F corridor unit** on the east area kerb of Kerry:
  - Expect **majority of Kerry office commuters from metro/parking to pass within 0–20 m**.
  - This would support higher capture rates (upper bound of previous 2–10% assumption).

## 6. Summary: Pros & Cons in terms of traffic

### Pros (traffic & accessibility)

- **Excellent metro integration**
  - 静安寺站 (lines 2/7/14) within **~3–6 min** walking.
  - Multiple exits (6/8/9) bringing flows within **≤300 m** of store.
- **Dense bus and rapid bus network**
  - ≥ 8 bus/express bus stops within **600 m**, many at **250–350 m**.
- **Abundant, directly connected parking**
  - Multiple Kerry underground parking zones within **30–100 m** (vertical plus short horizontal paths).
  - Additional public and private structures (中欣大厦, 九安广场, hotels) within **250 m**, giving thousands of daily car commuters.
- **High-quality commuter base**
  - Within the effective 5–10 min detour window:
    - **Jing’an Kerry offices: 10,000–15,000 workers**.
    - “Predictable corridor” early‑morning flows: **2,150–6,300 people**, with **total visible flows estimated 7,000–9,000**, upper 11,000–12,000 per workday morning.
  - Strong spending power, consistent schedules – ideal for medium–premium coffee.
- **Low detour cost for key segments**
  - Kerry office workers & mall staff: **0–5 min extra** to purchase coffee.
  - Kerry car commuters: **2–5 min extra**, often on the way to elevators.
  - Selected north‑belt offices and hotels: **5–8 min extra** but with higher basket sizes.
- **Weather-protected flows**
  - Many routes can be completed almost entirely **indoors** (metro concourse → mall → tower), improving consistency of traffic across seasons.

### Cons / Risks

- **Visibility entirely dependent on internal mall positioning**
  - If E1‑03 is not on a **primary commuter spine**, even a 30–50 m offset can sharply reduce effective flows.
- **Strong dependence on weekday office traffic**
  - Core customer base is **white‑collar weekday commuters**:
    - Weekend & public-holiday volumes will be lower and more mall/leisure‑driven.
- **High competition density**
  - The same high‑grade node attracts chain cafés and specialty brands.
  - Traffic is high, but **share of wallet must be fought for** via product and convenience.
- **Limited direct exposure to street-side or drive-by audiences**
  - Situated inside a large mixed-use complex; **no direct eyes‑on from passing cars or surface buses**.
  - Must rely on:
    - Mall signage
    - Digital channels / delivery
    - In-building promotions.

### Overall assessment for a morning-commuter boutique coffee shop

- **Transport access**:  
  - Objectively strong: multi-line interchange + dense bus + huge underground parking, all within **≤5–8 min** approach.
- **Traffic potential**:  
  - Realistic **morning visible flows** of **7,000–9,000 people**, with a **5‑min detour catchment** covering the majority of Kerry commuters and mall staff, and a **10‑min detour catchment** likely reaching **10,000–15,000+ office workers**.
- **Strategic implication**:  
  - If the actual unit is **on or immediately adjacent to the main metro → office → parking routes**, the traffic environment can support the higher capture‑rate scenarios from your previous analysis (280–630 cups / morning peak, with upside if brand & operations excel).  
  - If off-axis, expect a **material reduction in effective traffic**, and the business must lean more heavily on branding, digital ordering, and destination appeal rather than pure flow interception.
