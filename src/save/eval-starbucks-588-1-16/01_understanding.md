## Spatial context

- The site is in a **large mixed‑use riverside commercial cluster** on the **North Bund**, within **Hongkou District**.  
- Immediately **north** of the point A is an elevated corridor and green strip containing **Metro Line 4 (4号线)** and the **Shanghai International Cruise Terminal (上海国际客运中心)** area.  
- Immediately **south** is the **北外滩滨江绿地(北虹口)** riverside greenbelt and pedestrian promenade along the river, forming a continuous waterfront leisure space.

### Surrounding places and relative positioning

- **Shanghai International Cruise Terminal (上海国际客运中心)**: just to the **north** of your location, across the road/rail corridor, acting as a major transport and tourist node.
- **Metro Line 4 corridor**: also directly **north**, running roughly east‑west, providing strong commuter flow around the block.
- **北外滩滨江绿地(北虹口)**: directly to the **south**, along the river, within a very short walking distance from the mall, serving as a major riverside park and promenade.
- **CGV T SPACE 影院/茶馆**: a cinema/tea‑space located **to the east within the same or adjacent commercial block**, reachable by a brief indoor or street‑level walk.
- **中国工商银行（ICBC）网点**: also to the **east**, in the next building cluster, serving surrounding office workers and visitors.
- **Restaurants such as 平成屋 and other eateries**: mainly **to the west** and slightly north‑west within the same commercial aggregation, indicating a dense F&B environment.

In summary, the planned boutique coffee shop at A will sit **inside the ground‑level commercial podium of White Magnolia Plaza**, in a **high‑density office, tourism, and leisure zone** on the North Bund, with **Line 4 commuters, cruise passengers, and office workers** all within easy walking distance and the **riverside park** just to the south acting as an additional visitor draw.
