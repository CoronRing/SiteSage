# Evaluation Scores

## Customer Analysis: 8.2/10
Population and catchment strength score high (8.3) because the area combines ~59k residents in 1 km with a substantial 30k–40k daytime office population and consistent visitor flows, clearly in the ‘strong neighborhood/sub-center’ to ‘district hub’ range. Demographic and spending fit is also strong (8.5): working-age adults are the majority and the environment (Grade A offices, premium malls, multiple specialty coffee brands) shows clear existing coffee spend. The report details behavior and daypart dynamics thoroughly: Line 4 and dense bus service create 10k–18k morning passersby near the podium, with a carefully reasoned 2–3% conservative conversion and higher upside, justifying an 8.2 for customer behavior and peak demand. Opportunities and risks are net positive but not risk-free (7.5): North Bund’s continued development, landmark status, and mixed-use nature support future demand, but vacancy rates, heavy competition, and cruise seasonality temper the outlook, leading to a solid but not top-tier composite customer score of 8.2.

## Traffic & Accessibility: 8.3/10
Public transit and connectivity quality is rated 7.5 because the site has one major metro line plus an exceptionally dense bus network within 200 m and solid 20–30k daily station usage, fitting the rubric’s ‘good’ single-line strong-node band rather than multi-line hub territory. Walkability, parking, and road access merit a 9.0: sidewalks, indoor podium connections, and short, sheltered links from transit and parking to L1 provide excellent pedestrian conditions and sufficient structured parking. Target customer mobility fit is also high at 9.0; the report shows that most White Magnolia tower commuters face nearly zero detour and broader office/transit users typically add ≤5 minutes, well within the rubric’s ‘excellent’ commuter criteria. Traffic volume and temporal benefits score 8.2 because estimated effective morning passersby (roughly 10k–12k conservatively near the storefront) and alignment with the 07:30–10:30 peak are strong, though micro-siting uncertainty and intense internal competition mean the shop is close to but not definitively on the absolute primary spine. Weighting these sub-scores yields an overall traffic and accessibility score of 8.3.

## Competition Analysis: 4.7/10
Competitor density and micro-proximity is scored at the rubric’s hyper-cluster lower bound of 3.0: inside the same podium within roughly 150 m there are at least four branded coffee chains (Cotti, Manner, M Stand, Starbucks plus Starbucks Reserve) and several bakery/tea operators, easily meeting the interior-mall hyper-cluster rule that caps this sub-score at ≤3.5. Market saturation versus demand is assessed at 5.0, reflecting rough balance: the node’s strong traffic can support many outlets, but with ≈20–25 coffee shops in 500 m and no evidence of chronic unmet demand, new units must primarily reallocate share. Positioning opportunity earns 5.5 (‘adequate’): obvious niches like value, mainstream chain, and high-design boutique are already occupied, but the concept can still differentiate on speed and commuter focus between Manner/Cotti and Starbucks/M Stand. Competitive risk is high at 4.5 because multiple powerful incumbents—including a Reserve flagship and several chains—sit within ~100 m on the same flows and can respond aggressively with promos and landlord leverage. Weighted together, these sub-scores yield a net competition score of 4.7, indicating a structurally attractive node with meaningfully adverse competitive conditions that a new boutique must overcome through strong execution.
