## Public transit availability

**1. Metro (core commuter driver)**

- Nearest station: **国际客运中心站 (International Cruise Terminal, Line 4)**  
  - Main station point: ≈ **123 m** from the shop location.  
  - Entrances/exits around the mall (tool data):  
    - “国际客运中心地铁站出入口” at 31.249634, 121.497901 – **≈83 m**  
    - “国际客运中心地铁站3号口” – **≈109 m**  
    - “国际客运中心地铁站2号口” – **≈116 m**  
    - “国际客运中心地铁站1号口” – **≈172 m**  
    - “国际客运中心地铁站4号口” – **≈174 m**  
- Walking time from exits to L1-16 shop in White Magnolia Plaza:
  - Shortest paths: 80–180 m → **1–3 minutes on foot**.
- Functionally, any commuter using **Line 4** to access North Bund offices or the cruise terminal cluster must:
  - Exit into/next to **白玉兰广场/上港邮轮城** podium, then  
  - Walk through or around the same ground‑floor mall level where the coffee shop is located.

Given station daily volume from the previous analysis (≈25,000–30,000 entries/exits, ≈9,000–13,000 in morning peak), the coffee shop is **effectively integrated into the station catchment**.

---

**2. Bus network**

Within **600 m** of the shop, the tool returns multiple bus stops:

Closest (< 200 m):
- **白玉兰广场(公交站)** – 31.24873, 121.499092 – **≈68 m**  
- **东大名路旅顺路(公交站)** – 31.248458, 121.498688 – **≈72 m**  
- **上港邮轮城(公交站)** – 31.248051, 121.497891 – **≈130 m**  
- **东长治路旅顺路(公交站)** – 31.249722, 121.496765 – **≈180 m**

Mid-range (200–350 m):
- **东大名路高阳路(公交站)** – 296 m  
- **唐山路新建路(公交站)** – 327 m  

Outer ring (400–600 m):
- **东汉阳路梧州路(公交站)** – 424 m  
- **唐山路高阳路(公交站)** – 504 m  
- **白渡桥(公交站)** – 539 m  
- **东汉阳路沽阳路(公交站)** – 558 m  
- **东大名路丹徒路(公交站)** – 587 m  

Assuming typical Shanghai inner-city stop usage, these stops together likely handle **10,000–15,000 boardings/alightings per weekday**, with **2,000–4,000** in the 07:30–10:30 window, consistent with your previous customer analysis.

Most of these stops are on **东大名路 / 东长治路**, the main arterial immediately north of the mall; walking from any stop to mall entrances is **1–5 minutes**.

---

## Parking availability

(Precise counts not in the tool snapshot; estimates use known patterns of Grade A mixed‑use complexes in Shanghai.)

**1. On-site structured parking**

White Magnolia Plaza + surrounding North Bund complexes (上港邮轮城、双狮汇等) typically provide large underground parking:

- Likely **>800–1,200 spaces** within the same podium / basement system.  
- Access via ramps along **东长治路 / 东大名路 / 支路**; from car park to L1-16:
  - Elevator + short walk: **2–5 minutes** net.  
- Relevant for:
  - Office tenants who drive (esp. mid/upper management).  
  - Weekend and evening leisure visitors; less critical for morning-peaked take‑out business but still a segment.

**2. Street-level / short-stay options**

- Limited metered curb spaces along nearby secondary roads (旅顺路、支路) – typically **dozens, not hundreds**, and often fully occupied during office hours.  
- Practical for quick coffee pick‑up is low, as drivers prefer to park once underground and proceed to offices.

Net: For your **morning commuter** focus, transit and foot traffic matter far more than car access; parking is sufficient for those who do drive, but will not be the main volume driver.

## Customer flow analysis

### 1. Main segments and their movement paths

Using the earlier customer analysis as context:

- **Office workers (≈30,000–40,000 within 1 km; ≈8,000 in White Magnolia tower itself)**  
  Key buildings: 白玉兰广场办公塔、上港邮轮城办公楼群、北外滩周边甲级写字楼。

  Typical morning journey:
  1. Arrive by **Metro Line 4 – 国际客运中心站** or bus (白玉兰广场 / 东长治路旅顺路站等).  
  2. Exit upwards into/near **White Magnolia podium**.  
  3. Walk:
     - Either **through the mall L1/L2 concourse** to reach office elevators in the same complex, or  
     - Along **东长治路 / 东大名路** sidewalks toward neighboring offices west/east.

  This path naturally passes:
  - Mall ground‑floor corridors facing **metro exits and bus stop flows**.
  - Ground-level entrances where your L1-16 shop is situated.

  For workers **in the White Magnolia tower itself**, detour to the shop is minimal (see detour section).

- **Morning commuters continuing onward (non-local workers)**  
  - Some passengers may transfer at 国际客运中心 between **Line 4** and walking/bus to other districts.  
  - A portion (~5–10% of station users) might not work locally but change modes here (e.g., buses going deeper into Hongkou or to Baoshan).  
  - Many have **5–10 minutes buffer** in their commute; a coffee stop is realistic if:
    - The shop is on the **direct route from exit to bus stop / street**.
    - Service is fast (< 2 minutes order-to-drink for standard items).

- **Nearby residents (within 500 m: ≈16,190 residents; ≈9,652 working-age)**  
  Likely routes:
  - Walk or bike from residential compounds **north and northwest** of 东大名路 / 东长治路 toward Line 4, or toward offices on the riverfront.  
  - Their walking path crosses:
    - Over/underpasses around the rail corridor,  
    - Street crossings leading into the White Magnolia plaza or past its periphery.

  For early commuters (07:30–09:00), the shop is a **“on-the-way” stop** if:
  - They use the **station exits on the mall side**, or  
  - They cut through the mall on L1 instead of walking only along the street.

- **Tourists / cruise passengers (≈200–500 early in the day)**  
  - Arrive by taxi/bus/metro to reach the **Shanghai International Cruise Terminal** directly north.  
  - Many will walk through the same nodal area between station exits, riverfront promenade, and terminal building.
  - Early boarding or post‑cruise flows can create **off‑peak morning mini‑spikes**.

### 2. In-mall micro-flow

Because the shop is:

- **Inside the mall**, L1 level (ground-floor commercial podium),
- Near L1‑17 and presumably close to **main mall entrance or main internal corridor**,

the main internal flows are:

1. **Metro → Office tower core**  
   - High-density, time‑compressed flow 08:00–09:30.  
   - People will prioritize **shortest path** to elevators.  
   - If the coffee bar is directly along this line-of-movement, pass‑by rate could approach:
     - **20–30% of Line 4 morning exiters** walking within visual range (≈3,000–4,000 people).  
   - If slightly offset (need to turn off the straight route), pass‑by may drop closer to 10–15%.

2. **Metro / bus → Other nearby office buildings**  
   - These commuters may **exit the mall quickly** to reach external buildings.  
   - Their coffee grab must be **visible from the exit corridor or doors**, otherwise friction is high.

3. **Office tower → mall amenities (breakfast, quick errands)**  
   - Smaller but steady trickle 08:30–10:30 for people seeking breakfast/coffee before work or during first break.
   - These people already “belong” to the tower; conversion can be high if habit is formed.

## Detour estimation

Even though the static map tool timed out, we can estimate distances and walking times based on coordinates and prior knowledge.

### 1. Relative locations (schematic)

Use this conceptual map (not to scale, but directionally accurate):

```text
                 N
                 ^
                 |
      [Cruise Terminal]    [Line 4 Intl. Cruise Terminal Exits 1/2/3/4]
                 |                 ###
-----------------+-----------------###---- East Changzhi Rd / East Daming Rd
                 |                 ###
         (bus stops)         [White Magnolia Plaza Podium]
                                [Your Shop L1-16]
                 |
           [Beiwaitan
     Riverside Greenbelt]
                 |
                 S  (Huangpu River)
```

The shop is effectively just **south of the ring railway / Line 4 corridor** and **directly adjacent to the main pedestrian streams** from metro exits and bus stops.

### 2. Detour distances and times

Assumptions:
- Walking speed: **1.2–1.5 m/s** (≈4.3–5.4 km/h).  
- 100 m ≈ **1.2–1.5 minutes** including escalator/wait time in a mall.

**a) Metro commuters to White Magnolia office tower**

- Typical shortest path: Exit Line 4 → up to podium → cross 50–150 m of L1/L2 → tower elevator lobby.
- Extra distance to include your shop:
  - If on the natural corridor: **0–30 m extra** → **0–0.5 min** extra.  
  - If slightly off the line: **30–70 m extra** → **0.5–1.0 min** extra.

**Estimated morning detour for most tower workers:**
- **≤ 1 minute**, often **≤ 30 seconds**, if the shop is placed near the spine.

Within a **5-minute detour radius** from the station exits (roughly 350–450 m walking):

- You cover:
  - Most of White Magnolia tower (≈8,000 workers target)  
  - Adjacent office blocks north and south of 东长治路  
  - A portion of residential blocks to the north.

Given earlier numbers, in that 5-minute detour band during 07:30–10:30:
- Potential **metro + bus-arriving commuters** in realistic range:  
  - **≈8,000–10,000 people** (subset of 9,000–13,000 station movements + 2,000–4,000 bus users).

Within **10-minute detour** (700–900 m walking):

- You encompass:
  - Much of the **30,000–40,000 office workers** in the broader North Bund cluster,  
  - Most of the **16,190 residents within 500 m** and **59,256 within 1,000 m**.
- Not everyone will make such a long detour in the morning, but this is the **upper bound of reachable audience** for intentional visits.

If we apply realistic morning behavior:
- People willing to add **≤5 minutes** to commute:
  - Likely **20–35%** of those who regularly drink coffee.
  - Working-age share in catchment (59–62%) means:
    - Within 500 m: ≈9,652 working-age residents (you have already).  
    - Assume 10–20% are habitual weekday coffee buyers → **≈1,000–2,000 resident coffee‑users** in theory. Only a fraction (≈10–20%) will walk toward this node each morning → **≈100–400 potential resident buyers/day** reachable with ≤5-min detour.
- Office commuters: high alignment with path → effective detour usually **≤1–2 min**, which is extremely favorable.

**b) Bus commuters**

- For stops at 68–180 m:
  - Normal path: bus stop → station entrance / offices / mall entrances = **1–3 min**.  
  - Divert to shop inside L1: **extra 30–90 m** → **0.5–1.5 min** extra.
- Within a 5-min detour window, practically all these bus riders can include the shop; within 10 min, also those walking in from further bus stops (up to 600 m).

### 3. Quantifying people within 5- and 10-minute detour ranges (morning window)

Based on earlier station, bus and office data, focusing on **07:30–10:30**:

- **5-minute detour range** (0–400 m effective radius around mall & station):
  - Metro: majority of **9,000–13,000** peak movements; assume **70–80%** have feasible 5-min window → **≈6,300–10,400**.  
  - Bus: of the **2,000–4,000** bus riders, ≈70% alight within 200 m → **≈1,400–2,800**.  
  - Nearby office/resident pedestrians not captured by transit counts: conservatively **1,000–2,000**.
  - **Total 3-hour morning window with ≤5-min detour**:  
    - **≈8,700–15,200 individuals**.

- **10-minute detour range** (0–900 m effective radius around mall & station):
  - Encompasses a large share of the **30,000–40,000 office workers** plus residents walking/biking toward Line 4 or riverside offices.
  - Those willing to add up to 10 minutes will be fewer, but as **occasional / destination** visitors (meetings, client visits), this increases your potential reach.  
  - Reasonable estimate:  
    - **15,000–20,000** working-age individuals are structurally able to reach you within 10 extra minutes in the morning on days when they choose to.

## Visibility analysis

### 1. Macro visibility (outside the mall)

- The mall sits along **东长治路 / 东大名路**, both significant east–west arterials in Hongkou.  
- Tool results show multiple bus stops labeled **“白玉兰广场”** and “上港邮轮城”, indicating:
  - This complex is a **named node** in the bus network.  
  - Visual exposure of the building complex to both car and bus traffic is high.
- From the street, building signage and ground-floor glass façades should be visible to:
  - Thousands of drivers and bus passengers daily.  
- However, as your shop is **inside the podium (L1-16)**, macro visibility converts into customer recognition mostly via:
  - **Exterior mall signage / logo walls**.  
  - **Pylon signs near bus stops / metro exits**, if you can get your brand on them.

### 2. Micro visibility (inside the mall)

The crucial factor is whether L1-16 is:

- Directly on the **main pedestrian spine** connecting:
  - Metro exits ↔ Office tower elevator lobby ↔ Major mall entrances, or  
- Slightly **off‑axis**, requiring a turn into a side corridor.

Two scenarios:

1. **On primary path:**
   - Every metro-arriving office worker in White Magnolia tower effectively **passes within ~10–15 m** of the storefront each morning.  
   - Visual exposures in morning peak can reach:
     - **4,000–6,000 daily** in a conservative reading of the 10,000–12,000 passersby estimate near the storefront.

2. **Offset corridor:**
   - Only those purposefully seeking coffee or exploring the mall will enter.  
   - Effective passersby could drop to
     - **2,000–4,000** in the same time window.

For a **commuter coffee shop**, being **within direct line-of-sight from station exit / tower lobby** is critical. With the data given (L1-16 near L1-17 on ground floor, close to main activity), your previous estimate of **10,000–12,000 effective morning passersby in conservative case; up to 15,000–18,000 in strong case** is consistent with the transit/office geometry.

---

## Summary: Pros and Cons in terms of traffic

### Pros

- **Extremely strong transit adjacency**
  - **≈80–180 m** walk from Line 4 国际客运中心 station exits to the shop; **1–3 minutes**.  
  - Multiple bus stops within **70–180 m** (“白玉兰广场”, “东大名路旅顺路”, “上港邮轮城”, “东长治路旅顺路”).  
  - Combined morning traffic structurally positions **≈8,700–15,200** people within ≤5-min detour in the 07:30–10:30 window.

- **Minimal detour for main target: office commuters**
  - White Magnolia tower workers detour **0–1 min** from their natural path.  
  - Many surrounding office workers incur **≤5-min** extra walking time.

- **Dense and diverse local catchment**
  - Within 500 m: **≈16,190 residents**, 59–62% working age; within 1 km: **≈59,256 residents**.  
  - ≈**30,000–40,000 office workers** within 1 km, ≈8,000 in the tower above.  
  - Your earlier throughput estimate of **250–350 morning cups (base)** up to **600–800 (optimized)** is well supported by transit and footfall.

- **Node status in the urban network**
  - White Magnolia / North Bund is a named destination (bus stop naming, cruise terminal, CGV, bank).  
  - Strong **landmark effect** encourages meet-ups and repeat visits beyond strict commute usage.

- **Weather-resilient flows**
  - Much of the path from metro to offices can be **indoors or semi‑covered** via podium; rain or heat pushes more people to walk through the mall where your store sits.

### Cons / Constraints

- **In-mall visibility dependency**
  - As a unit **inside** the mall, street traffic only converts if:
    - Mall exterior signage is clear, and  
    - Internal positioning is on or very near the main commuter spine.
  - If L1-16 is one corridor away from the straight path, effective passerby count can drop to the lower end of your estimates.

- **Competition for the same commuter wallets**
  - North Bund and this podium host multiple **F&B and coffee competitors** (chain cafés, bakeries, tea shops).  
  - Many commuters pre‑commit to a brand/habit; winning share requires:
    - Strong visibility, speed, and consistent quality at **mid‑range boutique pricing**.

- **Office occupancy risk**
  - White Magnolia and nearby towers might run at **75–85% occupancy** (as noted):  
    - This caps the maximum office‑based morning flow until leasing improves.

- **Elderly-heavy residential share**
  - ≈20–21% of residents are 65+, who have **lower demand for boutique morning coffee**, especially at commuter times.  
  - Limits local residential upside vs. a younger district.

---

### Overall traffic potential assessment

- From an **accessibility and traffic** perspective, this L1-16 location in White Magnolia Plaza is **highly favorable** for your stated positioning:
  - Morning-focused, quick-service coffee for **office workers and transit commuters**.
- Quantitatively, with **≤1–2 minutes detour** for core office users and **≤5 minutes** for a large transit‑fed audience, the site supports your prior projection of:
  - **250–350 cups per weekday morning** as a practical base,  
  - with operational and visibility optimization raising that potentially toward **600–800 cups** in strong scenarios.

The next key lever is **micro‑siting inside L1** (angle, frontage, and sightlines from metro exit and office elevators) to fully convert the strong structural traffic into consistent sales.
