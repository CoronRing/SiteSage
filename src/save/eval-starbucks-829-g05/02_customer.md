## 2. Demographics within Multiple Radii

WorldPop residential population data (does **not** include commuters, office workers, tourists; only registered/actual residents). Coordinates: 31.234548, 121.475928.

### 2.1 Population & Age Breakdown

| Radius from store | Total Population | 0–14 yrs | 15–59 yrs | 60–64 yrs | 65+ yrs |
|-------------------|-----------------|----------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **300 m**         | **8,967**       | 593 (6.6%) | 6,145 (68.5%) | 713 (7.9%) | 1,585 (17.7%) |
| **500 m**         | **25,012**      | 1,785 (7.1%) | 17,215 (68.8%) | 2,019 (8.1%) | 4,559 (18.2%) |
| **1,000 m**       | **86,442**      | 6,149 (7.1%) | 58,144 (67.3%) | 6,935 (8.0%) | 15,152 (17.5%) |

**Implications:**

- Within **500 m** walking distance, there are about **25k residents**, of which ~**17k are working-age (15–59)**.  
- Within **1 km**, ~**86k residents**, ~**58k working-age**.  
- The elderly (60+) share is around **25–26%**, typical of central, older residential stock; **daytime dependency on external visitor flows is high**, so residential alone is **not** the main driver – commuters and tourists are.

For a **boutique coffee shop** targeting commuters and office workers, **real customer base** will be driven mainly by:

- Office workers in grade-A/B offices nearby  
- Metro passenger flows (People’s Square)  
- Tourist/shoppers on Nanjing East Road  
- Hotel guests  

---

## 3. Nearby Places & Functional Environment (≤ ~800 m)

### 3.1 Key commercial complexes (shopping malls / department stores)

(all distances from store)

- **上海世茂广场** – 30 m  
  - The store is inside or adjacent to this mall.  
  - 1–6F mall area ~43,200 m²; positioned as fashion/youth “潮流枢纽”.  
- **第一百货 / 第一百货商业中心 (A/B馆等)** – 135–150 m  
- **新世界城** – ~223 m west  
- **来福士广场 (People’s Square Raffles City)** – ~240 m south-west  
- **上海时装商店** – ~190 m  
- **百联永安百货** – ~220 m  
- **宝大祥青少年儿童购物中心** – ~160 m  

These create a continuous multi-mall retail cluster within **300 m**.

### 3.2 Transport nodes

- **人民广场地铁站 (People’s Square Metro Station)** – 200–230 m  
  - Lines **1, 2, 8** intersection, one of Shanghai’s busiest metro hubs.  
  - Multiple exits: No. 5, 7, 14, 19, 20 are within ~150–220 m of the store.  
- **Nanjing East Road tram / sightseeing bus stops** – ~30 m  
- Multiple **bus stops**:  
  - 人民广场(福州路)公交站 – ~214 m  
  - 九江路-浙江中路公交站 – ~219 m  

### 3.3 Offices & mixed-use buildings

Within 200–800 m:

- **腾飞元创大厦** – 150 m  
- Office components inside **Shimao**, **Raffles City**, **New World City** and surrounding towers (exact naming partly masked in POI data but known stock in People’s Square CBD).  
- Numerous traditional commercial buildings along **Jiujiang Road**, **Tibet Middle Road**, **Fuzhou Road** hosting:  
  - Finance / insurance  
  - Travel agencies  
  - Professional services  
  - Retail HQ offices  

Conservative estimate: within a **600–800 m** radius, office worker population (daytime) is easily **60k–80k+**, based on typical CBD office densities and published CBD employment data for People’s Square.

### 3.4 Hotels & serviced accommodation

Within 200–400 m:

- CONRAD / 上海康莱德酒店 – 20–30 m (in same complex)  
- 上海南新雅皇冠假日酒店 – ~100 m  
- 上海扬子饭店 – ~120 m  
- 景莱酒店·轻奢、繁花酒店、一间森林酒店、锦江之星品尚、珍宝酒店等 – 100–250 m  
- Several hostels & youth hostels (大隐国际青年旅舍等) – ~230 m  

Rough estimate: **> 2,000–3,000 hotel keys** within short walking distance. With 60–70% occupancy and 1.3–1.5 guests per room, that’s **1,500–3,000 in-house guests per night** in the micro-area.

### 3.5 Schools / education

- **留岸学院** – ~160 m (higher-education / training institution)  
- Various training institutions and language schools typically present in People’s Square towers (not all individually listed).  

Student & trainee daytime population: conservative **1,000–3,000** within 500–800 m.

### 3.6 Tourist & leisure attractions

Within 50–400 m:

- **南京东路步行街** itself – continuous retail + major tourist magnet  
- People’s Park & related attractions just to the north (implied by context)  
- Scenic spots: 南京东路观光车站、五卅惨案纪念地、西市庙会、南新雅广场雕塑、百岁山旧址、凯旋电台旧址等  
- **海底世界（水族馆）** – 30 m  
- Other cultural spots & red-tourism sites within 200–400 m  

### 3.7 Residential (within 300–800 m)

Although detailed per-building list is lengthy, the population stats confirm:

- Within **500 m**, ~**25k residents**; a portion are older core-city residents.  
- Within **1 km**, ~**86k residents**, spread across:  
  - Huangpu historic neighborhoods  
  - Older mid-rise communities  
  - Some newer apartment / serviced-apartment stock  

For boutique coffee, **nearby white-collar residents and serviced apartments** will be more important than older low-income communities, but the data show a **large and stable local base**.

---

## 4. Macro Foot Traffic Data (Nanjing East Road + Shimao)

### 4.1 Nanjing East Road pedestrian street

Public sources:

- Huangpu District & commercial-circle survey (2023, PDF):  
  - **Nanjing East Road commercial circle daily average visitor volume** ≈ **680,000 person-times/day** (春秋季 average).  
- Recent reports (2024–2025):  
  - Some articles cite single-day peaks **~500,000 person-times** in peak tourist seasons.  

To stay conservative, for **typical weekdays / normal season**, I’ll use:

- **Average Nanjing East Road pedestrian street:**  
  - **~400,000–500,000 person-times/day** as a working range  
  - Use **450,000/day** as midpoint for estimation.

### 4.2 Metro passenger volumes (People’s Square)

While exact 2024 entry-exit counts are not in the retrieved pages, prior studies and operator data historically put **People’s Square Station** among the top of Shanghai network:

- Reasonable conservative range: **600,000–900,000 metro entries+exits/day** (all directions).  
- Large share interchanges between Lines 1 / 2 / 8; not all will enter Nanjing East Road, but the station lies **~200 m from the store** and multiple exits spread along Nanjing East Road / Shimao side.

Assume:

- **30–40%** of these flows pass along or near Nanjing East Road west segment where Shimao is located.  
- Use **300,000/day** conservative figure of metro-related mobile population within **300–400 m** of the store.

### 4.3 Shimao Plaza & site-specific data

- Shanghai Shimao Plaza is the **landmark complex at Nanjing East Road 829** (site address matches).  
- One media info page about the **north wall lightbox ad at Nanjing East Road 829** quotes:  
  - **Daily traffic flow: 250,000 vehicles**  
  - **Daily pedestrian flow: 500,000 people**  
  - Festival/holiday: flows “double” (i.e. up to ~1 million people).  

This figure clearly counts **passing-by pedestrian flow in the visual area of the façade**, not purely internal mall visitors, and likely reflects **Nanjing East Road west section + metro exit region**, not pure mall entries.

To avoid overestimation:

- Use **“effective local corridor pedestrian flow” in front of Shimao** as:  
  - **300,000–500,000 person-times/day** range  
  - Use **350,000/day** for conservative customer modeling.

Internal mall-specific footfall (purely entering Shimao mall) is not explicitly published. Given Nanjing East Road average and Shimao’s share as one of several major malls, a reasonable assumption:

- Shimao mall **direct visitors**: **60,000–100,000 person-times/day** in-season  
- I will use **~70,000/day** as a conservative estimate for average day (mix of weekdays & weekends).

---

## 5. Main Customer Sources & Quantitative Estimation

For a **boutique coffee shop** here, the relevant **daily addressable population** during the **morning peak (e.g. 7:30–10:00)** comes from:

1. **Commuters via People’s Square Metro & street-level transfers**  
2. **Office workers in 500–800 m radius**  
3. **Tourists & shoppers on Nanjing East Road** (morning portion)  
4. **Hotel guests** within walking distance  
5. **Local residents** within 300–500 m, especially white-collar and younger segments.

### 5.1 Define morning time window

Assume main business window for peak:

- **7:30–10:00 (2.5 hours)**

For whole-day potential, I’ll also give a **daily maximum**.

### 5.2 Step-by-step customer pool estimation

#### 5.2.1 Metro commuters

Assumptions:

- People’s Square total daily entries+exits: **700,000 person-times** (midpoint in 600k–900k range).  
- Share within **effective catchment corridor** (exits leading toward Nanjing East Road / Shimao): **35%**  
  - → **245,000 person-times/day** using the corridor near the store.  
- Morning peak (7:30–10:00) share of daily metro commuter flow: **30–35%**  
  - Use **30%** to be conservative:  
  - **245,000 × 30% ≈ 73,500 person-times** passing through corridor in the morning window.  

Now, **practical addressable proportion** for a **single coffee shop**:

- Many commuters are in a rush, multiple competing coffee / breakfast outlets exist.  
- Assume **5–10%** of these commuters are in realistic proximity + time budget to consider a coffee purchase from *any* coffee outlet along that path.  
- Then assume the store, once established, can capture **10–20%** share of that accessible coffee demand (due to competition).  

Thus:

- Accessible commuter pool: **73,500 × 7% (midpoint of 5–10%) ≈ 5,145** people  
- Store’s capture share: **15%** (midpoint of 10–20%)  

→ **Commuter coffees from metro in morning peak ≈ 770 orders/day** (rounded).

To be conservative, I will **round down** and use **600–800 orders/day**, taking **700/day** as base-case.

#### 5.2.2 Nearby office workers

- Within **600–800 m**, daytime office worker population estimate: **60,000–80,000**.  
- Assume **50%** actually start work between 8:00–9:30 and are within practical walking paths that may pass the store or be willing to detour ≤3 minutes.  
  - → **30,000–40,000 relevant office workers**.  
- Coffee purchase rate in morning: typically **5–15%** for urban Chinese CBDs; for this location and price TBD, use **8–10%**.  
  - Use **9%** midpoint:  
  - **30,000–40,000 × 9% ≈ 2,700–3,600** potential daily morning coffee buyers in the area.  
- Store share amid all coffee competition (Chains, independents, convenience store coffee, tea drinks):  
  - Realistic initial market share: **8–15%** of total coffee purchases in this micro-area.  
  - Use **10%** as conservative average once store is known.

→ **Office-worker morning coffees ≈ (2,700–3,600) × 10% ≈ 270–360 orders/day**.  
Use **~300/day**.

#### 5.2.3 Tourists & shoppers in morning

- Nanjing East Road total pedestrians: assume **450,000 person-times/day**.  
- Morning (7:30–10:00) is lighter for tourists; assume **10–15%** of daily volume occurs then.  
  - Use **12%**: 450,000 × 12% ≈ **54,000 person-times**.  
- Only a fraction is near Shimao west section and within immediate frontage zone: assume **40%**.  
  - → ~**21,600 person-times** passing by within ~100 m of the store during morning.  
- Coffee purchase rate for tourists / leisure visitors in early morning: **2–6%**; use **3%**.  
  - → **21,600 × 3% ≈ 648** potential coffee purchases in the area.  
- Store share vs multiple competitors: assume **15%** (tourists often try prominent / new / photogenic stores).  

→ **Tourist/shopper morning coffees ≈ 650 × 15% ≈ 100 orders/day**.

#### 5.2.4 Hotel guests

- Estimate **2,500 in-house guests/night** within short walk (multiple large hotels + hostels).  
- Assume **30–40%** are potential coffee drinkers; use **35%** → **~875 individuals**.  
- Share who go out for coffee vs use hotel breakfast/buffet/bar: maybe **20–30%**; use **25%**:  
  - → **875 × 25% ≈ 219** people per morning in the broader area seeking external coffee/breakfast.  
- Of those, share that pass by or select the store: **20–30%**; use **25%**.  
  - → **219 × 25% ≈ 55** orders/day from hotel guests.

#### 5.2.5 Local residents (300–500 m)

- Within **500 m**: ~**25,000 residents**.  
- Assume **40%** are in age 20–59 with sufficient spending power and interest in specialty coffee (subset of working-age 15–59).  
  - 25,000 × 40% ≈ **10,000** targetable residents.  
- Assume **10–15%** of them buy coffee outside home at least once on weekdays, and **30–40%** of those purchases are in morning; use combined model:  
  - Daily morning coffee purchasers ≈ 10,000 × 12% × 35% ≈ **420**.  
- Store share vs other neighborhood options: **20–30%**; use **25%**.  

→ **Residents’ morning coffees ≈ 420 × 25% ≈ 105 orders/day**.

### 5.3 Morning peak – deterministic vs potential customer numbers

Add up the cross-checked conservative estimates:

- Metro commuters: **~700 orders/day**  
- Office workers (non-metro, local walk-ins): **~300 orders/day**  
- Tourists & shoppers: **~100 orders/day**  
- Hotel guests: **~55 orders/day**  
- Local residents: **~105 orders/day**

**Deterministic, conservative morning-peak order volume:**

- **Total ≈ 1,260 cups / orders per morning (7:30–10:00)**  

This assumes the concept is established and reasonably known but **not** market-dominant; it also assumes operational capacity can handle this throughput.

Given operational realities (queue constraints, bar capacity, marketing ramp-up), it is safer operationally to plan for:

- **Near-term realistic achievable morning peak:**  
  - **600–900 orders/day**  
- **Long-term potential if well-executed:**  
  - **1,200–1,500 orders/day** in the 2.5-hour window.

### 5.4 Whole-day (10–12 hours) customer potential

Coffee demand will extend beyond morning (office breaks, shoppers, tourists, evening). Typically in such CBD:

- Morning peak (7:30–10:00) may account for **40–55%** of total daily cups.  
- For a fast-service specialty shop, assume morning = **50%** of daily volume.

Given above morning estimates:

- **Deterministic whole-day conservative:**  
  - If morning 600–900 cups → daily **1,200–1,800 cups**.  
- **Upper potential whole-day:**  
  - If morning 1,200–1,500 cups → daily **2,400–3,000 cups**.

Therefore, **customer number ranges**:

- **Deterministic (prudent) range:**  
  - **1,200–1,800 paying customers (orders) per day** after ramp-up.  
- **Potential maximum (with strong execution + good product/brand):**  
  - **Up to ~3,000 orders per day** in peak seasons / weekends.

These figures align with:

- Corridor **passing-by pedestrian flow ~300k–350k/day**  
- Coffee penetration rates (2–10% depending on segment)  
- Shop capture shares (10–25% of segment-level coffee buyers)

## 6. Main Customer Sources – Structured Summary

**1. Commuting population**

- People’s Square metro station (Lines 1/2/8), hundreds of thousands of daily entries/exits.  
- Morning corridor near Shimao: ~**70k+** commuters in 2.5 hours.  
- **Key customer segment:** quick takeaway espresso/americano/latte, minimal seating needed.

**2. Office workers**

- 60k–80k office workers within 600–800 m.  
- Provide stable weekday demand:  
  - Morning commute  
  - 10:00–11:00 break  
  - 14:00–17:00 afternoon pick-me-up.  

**3. Tourists & shoppers on Nanjing East Road**

- Nanjing East Road daily **≈400k–500k visitors**, Shimao section a significant share.  
- Strong on weekends and holidays; large potential for **afternoon / evening** coffee + specialty offerings.

**4. Hotel guests**

- >2,000–3,000 rooms within 300 m; nightly **1,500–3,000 guests**.  
- Morning and late-evening demand, especially from international travelers and domestic young tourists seeking “specialty coffee” rather than hotel buffet coffee.

**5. Local residents**

- 25k residents within 500 m, 86k within 1 km.  
- Base for **repeat, low-friction visits**: residents walking to metro, dog-walking, casual strolls in the evening.  
- Important for **off-peak stability** (non-holiday weekdays).

## 7. Pros & Cons of the Location (Customer Perspective)

### Pros

- **Extremely high pedestrian volume:**  
  - Nanjing East Road & Shimao frontage estimates: **~300k–500k person-times/day**.  
  - Nanjing East Road commercial circle average ≈ **680k/day** visitors.

- **Multi-source, diversified customer base:**  
  - Residents (~25k in 500 m, 86k in 1 km)  
  - Office workers (~60–80k)  
  - Metro commuters (hundreds of thousands)  
  - Tourists & shoppers (Nanjing East Road ~450k/day)  
  - Hotel guests (~1.5–3k nightly).

- **Excellent morning commuter capture:**  
  - Very close to multiple metro exits and main walking corridors.  
  - Primarily takeaway format matches flow speed.

- **Strong all-day and seasonal potential:**  
  - Tourists and shoppers sustain **afternoon / evening** demand, reducing reliance on morning only.  
  - Event-driven surges (e-sports events, festivals, holidays) can push footfall significantly above average (Nanjing East Road and Shimao both host events).

- **Brand visibility & positioning:**  
  - Inside/at entrance of Shimao, a well-known “潮流” youth hub.  
  - Good address for a “flagship-like” boutique café image, attractive to 20–35 y/o demographic that Shimao targets.

### Cons / Risks

- **Very intense competition for coffee & F&B:**
  - Multiple chains (Starbucks, Luckin, Manner, NOWWA, etc.) and independent cafés exist within several hundred meters.  
  - Market share achievable (10–20% of coffee demand in segment) requires strong differentiation.

- **High rent & operating cost baseline:**
  - Nanjing East Road + Shimao mall rents among the highest in Shanghai F&B.  
  - The business model **must** reach at least **1,200+ cups/day** at adequate gross margin to be sustainable.

- **Flow volatility by season and time of week:**
  - Weekends / holidays can be 1.5–2+ × weekday volume.  
  - Early weekday mornings are strong, but mid-day working days may lean more to quick, value coffee (price sensitivity).

- **Customer composition complexity:**
  - Mix of commuters, tourists, local elderly, and white-collar workers requires **clear product & pricing strategy**.  
  - A concept that is too niche or too expensive might limit conversion from large but diverse flows.
