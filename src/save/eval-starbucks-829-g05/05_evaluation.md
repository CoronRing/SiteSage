# Evaluation Scores

## Customer Analysis: 9.2/10
Population and catchment strength score a clear 10.0: within 1 km there are 86k residents, 60–80k office workers, several thousand hotel guests nightly, and the node functions as a city-scale super-hub with Nanjing East Road pedestrian traffic (≈450k/day) and People’s Square station (600–900k entries/exits/day). Demographic and spending fit earns 8.5: the working-age, white-collar, tourist and hotel mix is highly favorable for boutique coffee, though a 25%+ elderly share and diverse tourist segments mean the target isn’t an outright majority of all people present. Customer behavior and daypart alignment merit about 9.0: the report gives a thorough, structured estimation of morning commuter, office, tourist, hotel, and resident demand, explicitly modeling a 7:30–10:00 peak and aligning it with a takeaway format and 3–5 minute detours; assumptions are generally conservative but still modeled rather than observed. Opportunities and risks deserve 9.0: the analysis clearly describes upside from massive, diversified flows and all-day demand while highlighting intense competition, high rent, and seasonal volatility, presenting a net strongly positive but not risk-free picture. Weighting these (10%, 10%, 70%, 10%) yields an overall customer score around 9.2, consistent with a top-tier CBD coffee location where execution and economics, not demand, are the primary constraints.

## Traffic & Accessibility: 9.2/10
Public transit and connectivity quality justifies 10.0: the store is effectively on top of People’s Square station with three metro lines, exits mostly within 150–300 m, and aggregate throughput far above the 250k/day threshold for a top-tier hub; major bus stops within ~200–300 m further reinforce this. Walkability, parking and road access rate around 9.0: the site is on a pedestrian street with continuous sidewalks and mall connections, plentiful underground parking within 3–8 minutes for those who drive, and no major physical barriers, though it is not suitable for quick car-stop visits. Target customer mobility fit earns 8.5: metro commuters and office workers can generally reach the shop with only a 3–5 minute detour from their natural station-to-office routes, satisfying the ‘good’ band; some segments (e.g., south-side commuters) do face closer to the 5-minute end, so it falls short of ‘excellent’. Traffic volume and temporal benefits score 9.0: the report ties node-wide flows (400–500k/day on Nanjing East Road and 300–500k/day in the Shimao frontage area) to the storefront’s likely corridors and to peak windows, especially 7:30–10:00, while acknowledging that exact internal positioning could moderate realized pass-by. Applying rubric weights (20%, 10%, 10%, 60%) to these sub-scores yields an overall traffic score of roughly 9.2, reflecting an extremely strong, transit-rich, high-footfall location with near-ideal access for a commuter-oriented coffee format.

## Competition Analysis: 4.5/10
Competitor density and micro-proximity score about 3.5: within 500 m there are roughly 50 coffee-focused outlets, with six in the 0–100 m band and a Starbucks Reserve essentially at 0 m plus another Starbucks at 30–50 m, alongside several chains within 150–300 m; this fits the rubric’s ‘interior-mall hyper-cluster’ description and calls for a low density score despite strong demand. Market saturation versus demand merits 4.5: while macro demand is huge, the analysis itself shows 60–70 coffee/breakfast alternatives against an estimated 2,520 daily coffee orders, implying modest per-store averages and a need for share capture rather than filling unmet demand, consistent with a somewhat over-supplied but still viable hub. Positioning opportunity is 5.5: the report identifies real but narrow spaces around ‘boutique + high-efficiency takeaway’ and possibly more serious specialty quality, yet most obvious niches (value, standard premium, sit-down, themed) are already occupied by powerful brands, so differentiation depends heavily on execution rather than structural white space. Competitive risk is around 4.0: a flagship Starbucks Reserve, multiple other Starbucks, Manner, Luckin, Cotti, Tims, Costa, and Peet’s sit in very close proximity on the same key flows, creating high risk of aggressive competitive responses and customer lock-in, especially in an interior-mall context governed by strong chains. Applying the rubric weights (20%, 30%, 25%, 25%) to these sub-scores yields an overall competition score near 4.5, reflecting a structurally tough, hyper-competitive environment where only a very sharply differentiated and well-executed concept is likely to secure sustainable volume and margins.
