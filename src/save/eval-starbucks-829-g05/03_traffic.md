## 1. Public transit availability

**Key finding:** The store sits almost directly on top of People’s Square transport hub’s north side, with dense subway and bus access within 150–300 m.

### 1.1 Subway

Nearest station: **人民广场站 (People’s Square, Lines 1 / 2 / 8)**

- Overall:
  - Station center (Amap POI “人民广场(地铁站)”) is **~221 m** from the store.
  - This station handles **≈600,000–900,000 entries/exits per day** (city stats; figures from your previous analysis are consistent).
- Nearest exits (all within ~300 m walking):
  - Exit “19” (label 1 on map): **153 m**
  - Exit “20”: **170 m**
  - Exit “14”: **173 m**
  - Exit “5”: **189 m**
  - Other exits (6, 7, 12, 15–18, etc.): **200–350 m**
- Realistic walking time from closest exits to 世茂广场咖啡店：
  - Distance: **250–350 m** (indoor + street level)
  - Time: **3–5 minutes** for typical 4–5 km/h walking speed.

**Implication for target segments**

- **Morning commuters (primarily metro)**: your storefront is within a **3–5 min** walk of multiple exits serving all three lines, so nearly all metro-based commuters to this CBD can pass within “coffee range” with a small detour.
- **Shoppers & tourists on 南京东路**: many arrive via People’s Square or 南京东路站; People’s Square side is already providing **direct feed** to your block.

### 1.2 Bus

Within an 800 m radius, there are multiple bus stops; key ones nearby:

- **人民广场(西藏中路) / 人民广场(福州路) / 人民广场(地铁站)** bus clusters
  - Example POIs:
    - 人民广场(西藏中路)公交站: **≈211–214 m**
    - 人民广场(福州路)公交站: **≈214 m**
  - These hubs serve many trunk routes going along:
    - **西藏中路** (north–south)
    - **福州路**, **九江路**, **延安东路**, etc.
- **南京路步行街(浙江中路) / 九江路浙江中路 / 南京路世纪广场** bus nodes:
  - 南京路步行街(浙江中路)公交站: **≈219 m** east of store on 南京东路。
  - 南京路世纪广场公交站: **≈262 m**.

Typical bus passenger volumes on these central routes are in the **tens of thousands per direction per day**. Given your 300–400 m catchment along 南京东路, bus passengers disembarking at these stops are within **4–6 minutes** walk.

### 1.3 Train / regional access

- There is **no intercity train station** within 800 m (Shanghai Railway Station is ≈3–4 km away), but:
  - Many regional travelers interconnect via subway to People’s Square.
  - The store thus indirectly taps regional business travelers and tourists who interchange at People’s Square before going to hotels and offices.

---

## 2. Parking availability

Within 800 m, this dense CBD has **multiple large underground & building car parks** (exact POIs not all labeled as “parking” in the returned data, but known major facilities include):

- **上海世茂广场地下停车场**
  - Directly below/attached to your store’s mall.
  - Typical capacity in similar Grade-A CBD malls: **≈300–600 parking spaces**.
  - Elevator access likely within **1–2 minutes** to your floor.
- **Surrounding complexes** (New World City, 第一百货, 来福士, 写字楼等)
  - Each with **200–500 spaces**.
  - Distance to your unit: **200–600 m** (≈3–8 minutes indoor/outdoor walking).

Implication:

- **Drivers staying for work or shopping** will park for hours and move on foot within the superblock. For them, your store is effectively part of the pedestrian network rather than a car-stop destination.
- **Short-stop coffee by car** is less relevant because:
  - Driving into these garages + elevators already costs **8–15 minutes**.
  - Your concept is better tuned to **foot traffic from parked cars**, not drive-up traffic.

## 3. Customer flow analysis

Using your previous customer analysis plus the new spatial/transit info:

### 3.1 Main customer origins and directions

1. **Morning commuters (metro)**
   - Arrive at: **人民广场站 (Lines 1/2/8)**.
   - Typical onward directions:
     - **North / NE** toward **九江路–北京东路–黄河路** office strip.

   - Your store’s location:
     - On **南京东路/世茂广场** just east of 西藏中路.
     - This sits **directly on the eastward and partial NE commuting paths**, and is a **slight detour** for southbound office commuters.

2. **Nearby office workers**
   - Main office clusters:
     - **九江路 / 西藏中路** corridor (north of 南京东路).
     - **福州路 / 西藏中路** corridor (south of 南京东路).
     - Additional towers around **腾飞元创大厦**, 世茂办公部分, 来福士, 南京东路两侧写字楼。
   - Flows:

     - Midday & afternoon: office → mall/streets for meals and errands.
   - Your shop:
     - Lies roughly **midpoint between 九江路和福州路** on the **east side of 西藏中路**, so it can capture:
       - **North-south crossers** using 世茂/南京东路作为穿行通路。
       - **Office → lunch spots → office** flows cutting through the mall.

3. **Shoppers and passersby on 南京东路**

   - 世茂广场及门店正面通道有效人流：**300,000–500,000 人/日**（你提供的测算）。
   - Flows:
     - Bidirectional east–west tidal flows between **人民广场** and **外滩/河南中路方向**.
   - Your store:
     - Inline with this stream; **no detour** if you have a **street-facing or clearly visible entrance**.
     - Internal location (like current Starbucks) still directly on a **major internal circulation corridor**.

4. **Local residents & hotel guests**
   - 500 m resident population: **≈25,000**.
   - 1,000 m resident population: **≈86,000**.
   - Hotels: **2,000–3,000 rooms**, **1,500–3,000 guests/night**.
   - Flow patterns:
     - Residents: short walks along **九江路、福州路、黄河路、浙江中路** into the pedestrian zone.
     - Hotel guests: check-in/out via **taxis/ride-hailing** to hotel entrances, then move mostly on foot to People’s Square, 南京东路、博物馆、人民公园.
   - Your store:
     - Becomes a **neighborhood specialty coffee option** for residents within **600–800 m**, especially those using 南京东路 daily.

## 4. Detour estimation

### 4.1 Static map

![Static Map – Store and Key Transit](https://restapi.amap.com/v3/staticmap?location=121.475928%2C31.234548&zoom=16&size=512%2A512&markers=mid%2C%2CA%3A121.475928%2C31.234548%7Cmid%2C%2CM%3A121.475108%2C31.232687%7Cmid%2C%2C1%3A121.474362%2C31.234217%7Cmid%2C%2CB%3A121.478229%2C31.234408%7Cmid%2C%2CC%3A121.475734%2C31.232652&key=68913ce8db83f7bbe5b4cca9720c7a8f)

- **A**: Your coffee shop / 世茂广场 G05.
- **1**: People’s Square metro exit north-west.
- **M**: Central/southern People’s Square exit cluster (near People’s Park).
- **C**: Another south-side exit cluster, near 福州路/西藏中路.
- **B**: 南京路步行街(浙江中路) / 南京路世纪广场 bus node (east).

### 4.2 Metro commuter → office and coffee detours

Using walking speed ≈ **80 m / min** (4.8 km/h):

1. **Metro → office (no coffee)**  
   - To 九江路/西藏中路:
     - From best metro exits: **150–250 m** → **2–3 min**.
   - To 福州路/西藏中路:
     - From best exits: **200–300 m** → **3–4 min**.

2. **Metro → coffee → office (with your shop)**

- From **north-side exit (e.g., 19)** to **coffee**:
  - Exit → store: **250–350 m** → **3–5 min**.
  - Store → 九江路/西藏中路 offices:
    - South or north adjustment then back: **400–550 m** → **6–8 min**.
  - Extra vs metro→office direct:
    - Additional distance: roughly **200–350 m**.
    - Extra time: **3–5 min**.

- From **south-side exits (M/C)** to **coffee**:
  - Exit → store: **400–550 m** → **6–8 min**.
  - Store → 福州路/西藏中路 offices: **450–600 m** → **7–9 min**.
  - Compared to going straight exit→office:
    - Extra distance: **250–350 m**.
    - Extra time: **3–5 min**.

**Conclusion for office commuters:**  
For a typical white-collar commuter in this area, a coffee stop at your store adds **about 3–5 minutes** of walking compared with the shortest path from metro to office, which is within their tolerated detour for **takeaway coffee**.

### 4.3 Shoppers / pedestrians on 南京东路

- **People’s Square → east along 南京东路 pedestrian street**:
  - People’s Square center → your store: **~300–400 m** → **4–5 min**.
  - Your store → 新世界城 / 第一百货: **200–400 m**.
- For east-bound shoppers:
  - **No real detour**; the store is on their natural path.
- For west-bound shoppers from 新世界城/第一百货:
  - Additional in–mall deviation: **50–150 m / 1–2 min** depending on in-mall location.

### 4.4 Approximate 5-min / 10-min detour reach (relevant customers)

Using a circle radius and your customer volumes (from previous analysis):

- 5-minute **detour** range (~400 m around store, or ±200 m off natural path):
  - Encompasses:
    - Most **People’s Square exits**.
    - Northern side of **人民公园**.
    - Office blocks within **≈300–400 m** of 西藏中路 on 九江路和福州路.
  - Effective relevant groups:
    - Portion of metro commuters whose route crosses 西藏中路/南京东路 or who work within 400–500 m:
      - Within your previous estimate of **600–800 cups/日** from metro commuters, at least **50–70%** are in ≤5-min detour → **≈300–560 potential cups/早高峰**.
    - Office workers within 400–500 m: perhaps **40–60% of the 60,000–80,000** day workers → **24,000–48,000** people within easy coffee radius.

- 10-minute **detour** range (~800 m / ±400 m off route):
  - Covers:
    - Most of the **人民广场–南京东路–外滩** superblock.
    - Major shopping complexes (新世界城、来福士、第一百货等) and hotel cluster.
  - From prior estimates:
    - Residents within 1 km: **≈86,000**.
    - Office population: **≈60,000–80,000**.
    - Tourists/shoppers: **400,000–500,000 / day** moving through 南京东路.
  - Reasonable to assume:
    - **≥70–80%** of all these flows could reach you within **10 extra minutes** walking if they choose to.

## 5. Visibility analysis

### 5.1 Macro visibility (in the city)

- **Intersection-level visibility**
  - Location: 南京东路步行街中段、紧邻 西藏中路 + 人民广场北缘。
  - This is one of **Shanghai’s highest pedestrian volumes intersections**:
    - Road vehicle volume on 西藏中路: **tens of thousands of vehicles/day**.
    - Pedestrian flow on 南京东路 at this segment: **hundreds of thousands/day**.
- For non-mall tenants with **street frontage** here:
  - Visibility to **both directions of pedestrian stream** is almost guaranteed.
  - Many people pass **daily and repeatedly**, especially office workers and commuters.

### 5.2 In-mall visibility

The description suggests the unit is **inside 世茂广场 or immediately at its entrance**:

- If **facing the street / open to pedestrian street**:
  - Visibility similar to standalone street-front café.
  - Anyone walking between People’s Square and eastern 南京东路 will have **line-of-sight** or at least signage-level awareness.
- If **inside the mall corridor** (like current Starbucks 精选):
  - Visibility depends strongly on:
    - Whether corridor is on **main through traffic line** from **metro-linked entrances** to the **mall atrium**.
    - Distance from main doors; currently, 世茂 has:
      - High-footfall entrances directly on 南京东路 and 西藏中路.
  - From existing footfall estimates (30–50 万人次/日 through main passages), we can infer:
    - Corridor where the coffee shop sits likely has **tens of thousands** passing daily during **07:30–10:00 + 12:00–14:00**.

### 5.3 Competition visibility

Inside 世茂 & nearby:

- Within **0–100 m** of your point, there are **multiple F&B competitors**:
  - Starbucks 精选 (current POI at same coordinates).
  - LELECHA, 桂桂茶, 奶茶、甜品、餐厅等超过 10 家在 50 m 内。
- This means:
  - Customers have **many beverage choices** visually available.
  - But high-visibility location + differentiated concept (e.g., boutique / specialty / faster service at peak) can still command share.

## 6. Summary – Pros & Cons for traffic

### Pros (traffic & accessibility)

- **Extreme public transit accessibility**
  - ≤ **5 min** walk from multiple People’s Square subway exits (Lines 1/2/8).
  - Dense bus network; many lines stop within **≈250 m**.
  - Effective coverage to daily flows of **600,000–900,000 metro** + large bus ridership.
- **High pedestrian intensity around store**
  - 南京东路商圈 daily visitors: **400,000–500,000**.
  - 世茂广场主通道人流：**300,000–500,000 / 日**.
- **Detour tolerance for commuters**
  - Metro commuter adding coffee stop needs only **3–5 min extra** vs direct route to nearby offices.
  - Offices in 九州福州带 within **6–9 min** walking distance.
- **Dense target customer base in 5–10 min radius**
  - 500 m 内常住居民 ≈ **25,000**。
  - 1 km 内居民 ≈ **86,000**；办公人口 **60,000–80,000**；酒店住客 **1,500–3,000/夜**。
  - Portion of these groups within **≤5 min detour**: **≈24,000–48,000** office workers + several thousand residents & hotel guests.
- **Strong alignment with service mode**
  - Primarily takeaway & quick-service:
    - Matches **transit-oriented, time-constrained** flows (metro commuters, office workers).
- **Visibility in a landmark commercial zone**
  - Directly on / inside 南京东路步行街 + 世茂广场, a well-known destination, ensuring **high awareness**.

### Cons / Challenges (traffic-related)

- **Competition density**
  - Within **100 m**, more than **10+ F&B/tea/coffee brands**, including a Starbucks at the exact location in current mapping.
  - Requires **clear differentiation** (quality, specialty, speed, experiential design) to convert traffic into your own sales.
- **Internal mall location risk**
  - If your shop is **not at a primary entrance or main flow corridor**, but rather slightly recessed:
    - Realized footfall may be significantly less than **total mall numbers**.
    - Layout and signage must push you onto the **natural walking line** of commuters (e.g., between 南京东路大门 and key escalators).
- **Limited car-convenience**
  - Despite large parking supply, car users face **8–15 minutes** total parking cycle; not ideal for “drive-by” quick coffee.
  - However, this is typical for CBD pedestrian malls and is offset by transit and walking flows.

---

**Overall assessment:**  
For a **boutique, commuter-oriented specialty coffee shop**, this location is extremely strong in terms of **accessibility by subway & foot, customer volume within short detour times, and visibility along 南京东路 pedestrian flows**. To fully exploit the traffic potential quantified above (early peak target **600–900 cups/day**, total **1,200–1,800 cups/day**), execution must focus on:

- Capturing **metro-to-office flows** with clear sightlines from main mall entrances and fast, efficient morning operations.
- Standing out amidst **dense beverage competition** through product and service differentiation.
- Ensuring store placement aligns with **main pedestrian corridors** inside 世茂广场, minimizing any “hidden” effect relative to the natural flows illustrated.
