Effective Node Volume (RSV proxy) – **65%**\n2. Saturation & Per-capita Competition – **15%**\n3. Positioning White Space – **10%**\n4. Anchor / Incumbent Risk – **10%**\n\nFinal score = weighted average of 4 dimensions, then adjusted by gates in Section 5.\n\n---\n1. Effective Node Volume (RSV proxy) – 65%\n\n1.1 Required inputs\n- **Effective passers (by daypart, within 0–50 m of frontage)**\n  - Morning peak (7:30–10:30) – only people passing within ~0–50 m on real desire lines.\n  - Other dayparts (lunch, afternoon, evening) – only if flows pass within ~0–50 m.\n- **Daily-path base (0–100 m)**\n  - Office workers, students, mall staff whose **daily path** passes within 0–100 m.\n  - Residents within 800–1,000 m who are likely **weekly visitors** to this node.\n- **Coffee penetration assumptions (daily buyers among relevant users)**\n  - Mature CBD / dense office cluster: **8–10%**.\n  - Strong mixed-use mall + offices: **6–8%**.\n  - Community / weaker coffee culture: **3–6%**.\n- **New-store share assumptions (of total coffee volume at node)**\n  - Heavy saturation, many strong brands on same corridor: **3–6%**.\n  - Moderate competition, good micro-position: **6–10%**.\n  - Light competition, strong micro-position: **10–15%**.\n  - Adjust down if micro-position off main line or detour >3 min vs peers.\n\n1.2 Estimating RSV (step-by-step)\n- Step 1 – **Effective daily users**\n  - Start from morning 0–50 m flows; add other dayparts that also pass 0–50 m (use conservative estimates, avoid counting whole-station entries).\n- Step 2 – **Theoretical coffee volume**\n  - Theoretical cups/day = effective users × appropriate penetration % (use mid-point of range).\n- Step 3 – **New-store share**\n  - Choose share band based on competition and micro-position.\n  - Reduce share if multiple similar brands sit directly on same 0–50 m path.\n- Step 4 – **RSV (realistic sustainable cups/day)**\n  - RSV = theoretical cups/day × new-store share.\n  - Cross-check vs observed benchmarks for similar brands at the node.\n\n1.3 Scoring bands (by RSV)\n- **Excellent (9.0–10.0)**\n  - RSV ≥ 1,000 cups/day.\n- **Very strong (8.0–8.9)**\n  - RSV 800–999 cups/day.\n- **Strong (7.0–7.9)**\n  - RSV 600–799 cups/day.\n- **Upper-adequate (6.0–6.9)**\n  - RSV 450–599 cups/day.\n- **Adequate (5.0–5.9)**\n  - RSV 350–449 cups/day.\n- **Weak (4.0–4.9)**\n  - RSV 250–349 cups/day.\n- **Failing / Marginal (0.0–3.9)**\n  - RSV < 250 cups/day.\n\n1.4 Guardrails & sensitivity\n- If **effective morning peak passers within 0–50 m ≥ 12,000** and per-capita competition (see 2.2) is not extreme (>4 outlets per 10k users):\n  - Effective Node Volume score should normally be **≥ 7.5** even if competition is dense.\n- If effective morning peak passers within 0–50 m are **6,000–11,999** and RSV **450–699**:\n  - Score should normally be **≥ 6.5**.\n- If effective morning peak passers within 0–50 m **≤ 4,000** and RSV **≤ 350**:\n  - Score should normally be **≤ 6.0**.\n- **Cross-location sensitivity (same city / decision set):**\n  - If two locations’ estimated RSV differ by a factor **≥ 2.0**, their Effective Node Volume scores must differ by **≥ 2.0 points** in the same direction.\n  - If RSV ratio is **1.5–2.0**, their Effective Node Volume scores must differ by **≥ 1.0 point** in the same direction.\n\n---\n2. Saturation & Per-capita Competition – 15%\n\n2.1 Inputs\n- Count **direct substitutes** (coffee-first; plus bakeries/tea that realistically capture morning coffee) in rings:\n  - 0–25 m – same frontage / same immediate cluster.\n  - 25–100 m – same corridor or side of main street.\n  - 100–300 m – same node, short walk.\n- Within 300 m, estimate **effective daily users** who can reach with ≤3 min detour (from Section 1 inputs).\n- Compute **per-capita density**:\n  - Direct coffee outlets (including coffee-strong bakeries) **per 10,000 effective daily users**.\n- Note **qualitative saturation signals**:\n  - Many quiet or visibly weak units.\n  - Heavy, persistent discounting.\n  - Recent closures on same corridor.\n\n2.2 Scoring bands (combine absolute counts + per-capita)\n- **Excellent (9.0–10.0)**\n  - ≤ 3 direct coffee outlets within 100 m; and\n  - ≤ 10 direct coffee outlets within 300 m; and\n  - ≤ 1.5 direct outlets per 10k effective daily users; and\n  - Few/no weak or empty units.\n- **Good (7.0–8.9)**\n  - 4–6 direct outlets within 100 m; or\n  - 11–18 within 300 m; and\n  - 1.6–2.5 outlets per 10k effective users; and\n  - Most units healthy, no clear oversupply.\n- **Adequate (5.0–6.9)**\n  - 7–9 direct outlets within 100 m; or\n  - 19–30 within 300 m; or\n  - 2.6–3.5 outlets per 10k effective users;\n  - Node still has strong Effective Node Volume (score ≥ 6.5) and most peers appear healthy.\n- **Poor (3.0–4.9)**\n  - ≥ 10 direct outlets within 100 m; or\n  - 31–45 within 300 m; or\n  - > 3.5 outlets per 10k effective users; or\n  - Clear signs that additional similar stores mostly cannibalise share (weak units despite good traffic).\n- **Extreme saturation (0.0–2.9)**\n  - > 50 coffee-related outlets within 500 m; and\n  - Multiple visibly weak or half-empty coffee units on same main flows; and\n  - Per-capita density clearly above sustainable norms (> 4.5 direct outlets per 10k effective users).\n\n2.3 Scale-sensitive notes\n- In **very high-volume CBD nodes** with many outlets but still healthy peers, do **not** automatically push this score into 0–2 range; use **3–5** unless there is evidence of structural oversupply.\n- In **medium-volume suburban/commercial nodes** with much lower effective passers, similar outlet counts should be penalized **more harshly** via per-capita density.\n\n---\n3. Positioning White Space – 10%\n\n3.1 Checks\n- **Coverage by incumbent formats on same main flows (0–100 m)**\n  - Value commuter chains (Luckin/Cotti-style).\n  - Mass specialty (Manner-style).\n  - Global brands (Starbucks/Costa/Tims).\n  - Premium boutiques / design cafés.\n  - Brunch/bakery sit-down with strong coffee.\n- **Daypart coverage** by incumbents (7–9 am commute, lunch, afternoon, evening).\n- **Potential roles for new store on same flows**\n  - Fastest high-quality commuter option (order-to-drink ≤ 60–90 sec) with clear proof of speed vs peers.\n  - Distinctive product / roast / flavor profile that is clearly different from nearby chains.\n  - Only or clearly best option for a specific sizeable niche (e.g., serious coffee + grab-and-go breakfast on that corridor).\n- Estimate **incremental uplift** from differentiation vs being a generic follower (cups/day).\n\n3.2 Scoring bands\n- **Excellent (9.0–10.0)**\n  - Clear structural white space on main flows (0–50 m), e.g.:\n    - No truly fast commuter-focused specialty outlet; or\n    - No serious specialty-quality player despite obvious quality-seeking base.\n  - Plausible incremental uplift from differentiation **≥ 400–500 cups/day** vs a generic offer.\n- **Good (7.0–8.9)**\n  - 1–2 strong, monetizable differentiation angles despite similar brands; visible pain points (queues, slow service, weak breakfast, tourist-only focus).\n  - Incremental potential ≈ **250–400 cups/day**.\n- **Adequate (5.0–6.9)**\n  - Some white space but narrow or execution-dependent; most price/format slots are already covered.\n  - Incremental potential ≈ **150–250 cups/day**.\n- **Poor (3.0–4.9)**\n  - All major positions (value commuter, mass specialty, premium sit-down, design boutique, breakfast+coffee) already held by 2+ strong players on same flows.\n  - Incremental potential likely **≤ 150 cups/day**.\n- **Insufficient (0.0–2.9)**\n  - No credible, monetizable white space; new store is effectively redundant on the corridor.\n\n3.3 Volume-linked caps\n- If Effective Node Volume score **≤ 4.0** (RSV < 350):\n  - Positioning White Space score should normally be **≤ 6.0**.\n- If Effective Node Volume score **≤ 3.0** (RSV < 250):\n  - Positioning White Space score should normally be **≤ 5.0**.\n\n---\n4. Anchor / Incumbent Risk – 10%\n\n4.1 Inputs\n- Presence and proximity (0–100 m) of **top-tier brands on same flows**:\n  - Starbucks (especially Reserve/flagship), Manner, Luckin, Cotti, M Stand, Peet's, %Arabica, Blue Bottle, major bakery-café anchors.\n- **Hero or flagship units**:\n  - Reserve/Roastery, iconic specialty bars, landmark kiosks directly on main exits.\n- **Depth of clustering** of strong brands around the site (how many within 0–50 m and 50–100 m on main paths).\n- **Competitive behaviour**:\n  - Aggressive digital promotions, large app ecosystems, delivery dominance, corporate tie-ups.\n\n4.2 Scoring bands\n- **Excellent (9.0–10.0)**\n  - No top-tier chains within 50 m on main flows; and\n  - At most 1–2 within 100 m, with clearly different price tiers or primary dayparts.\n- **Good (7.0–8.9)**\n  - 1–2 strong chains within 50 m with only partial overlap; or\n  - 3–4 within 100 m but mixed formats (e.g., more sit-down, more tourist focus) and strong node volume.\n- **Adequate (5.0–6.9)**\n  - 2–3 strong chains within 50 m, overlapping some core use cases; or\n  - 5–6 within 100 m, but no single hero flagship directly on top of the site.\n- **Poor (3.0–4.9)**\n  - ≥ 1 hero/flagship unit (e.g., Reserve, iconic flagship) within 25 m **directly overlapping** target use; and/or\n  - ≥ 4 strong chains within 50 m or ≥ 7 within 100 m on same flows.\n- **Extreme (0.0–2.9)**\n  - Hero/flagship unit essentially co-located (0–10 m) plus multiple strong chains (≥ 3) within 50 m on same flow; or\n  - Clear pattern of similar entrants failing recently on the same frontage.\n\n4.3 Scale-sensitive notes\n- In **extremely large nodes** with very high RSV (≥ 900), strong anchors still matter but should not fully override volume:\n  - Do not raise this dimension above **6.0** if a hero/flagship is co-located on the same flow.\n\n---\n5. Gates and Cross-node Consistency\n\n5.1 RSV-based caps on final score\n- If Effective Node Volume score **≤ 2.9** (RSV < 250):\n  - Cap final score at **4.5**.\n- If Effective Node Volume score **3.0–3.9** (RSV 250–299):\n  - Cap final score at **5.5**.\n- If Effective Node Volume score **4.0–4.4** (RSV 300–349):\n  - Cap final score at **6.5**.\n\n5.2 Extreme anchor override caps\n- If there is a **hero/flagship unit within 0–10 m** directly overlapping the new store's core use; and\n  - There are **≥ 3 other strong chains within 50 m**, or **≥ 6 within 100 m** on the same flows:\n    - Cap final score at **6.5**.\n- If there is a hero/flagship within 0–25 m and Saturation & Per-capita Competition score **≤ 4.0**:\n  - Cap final score at **7.0**.\n\n5.3 Protection for very strong, less-saturated nodes\n- If Effective Node Volume score **≥ 8.0** and Saturation & Per-capita Competition score **≥ 5.0**:\n  - Do not cap final score below **7.0** solely due to anchor presence.\n\n5.4 Cross-node spread rules (same city / same decision set)\n- Define RSV bands by daily cups:\n  - Band A: < 250\n  - Band B: 250–349\n  - Band C: 350–449\n  - Band D: 450–599\n  - Band E: 600–799\n  - Band F: ≥ 800\n- When comparing two locations:\n  - If they fall **two or more bands apart** (e.g., B vs D, C vs E):\n    - Their final scores should differ by **≥ 2.0 points** in the direction of the higher RSV.\n  - If they fall in **adjacent bands** (e.g., C vs D):\n    - Their final scores should differ by **≥ 1.0 point** in the direction of the higher RSV.\n  - If RSV ratio **≥ 2.0 or ≤ 0.5**:\n    - Avoid giving final scores whose **ratio is < 1.3** in the opposite direction or nearly flat.\n\n5.5 Application notes (for report writers)\n- Always base Effective Node Volume on **0–50 m flows by daypart**, not entire-station or district traffic.\n- Treat **time-based catchments (e.g., 5–10 min walk)** only as support for understanding where users come from, not as direct substitutes for 0–50 m passers.\n- In highly saturated CBD / flagship clusters with 40–70 coffee-related outlets in 500 m, default to **low new-store share** unless there is quantified evidence for higher share – but still respect very high effective traffic.\n- In dense office clusters with high effective passers and fewer outlets per user, allow RSV and final scores to be **meaningfully higher** than in mid-volume suburban malls with similar raw outlet counts.",
    "weakness": [
        "Effective Node Volume dimension was underweighted (55%) and used wide bands, so large real differences in traffic and RSV produced only small score gaps.",
        "Saturation and Anchor dimensions penalised high-volume flagship CBD nodes heavily based on absolute outlet counts, without normalising enough for effective traffic volume.",
        "Cross-node consistency rules only protected ordering, not the magnitude of score differences when RSV differed strongly.",
        "Per-capita competition (outlets per effective user) was not explicitly enforced, allowing mid-volume nodes with similar outlet counts to appear almost as penalised as very high-volume nodes."
    ],
    "problems": [
        "Reports used inconsistent definitions of effective traffic: one focused on 0–30/50 m corridor flows, the other mixed 5–10 minute walk catchments, reducing comparability of node volume estimates.",
        "Neither report converted footfall and user-base estimates into a single, explicit RSV number for the new store, making it easier to compress Node Volume scores.",
        "Both reports devoted extensive detail to competitive density and positioning narratives, but did not clearly quantify the new store's expected share of total coffee volume.",
        "The treatment of convenience/visibility vs station entries was uneven, with some reliance on whole-area or mall-level visitor numbers instead of strictly 0–50 m effective passers."
    ],
    "revisions": [
        "Increased the weight of Effective Node Volume from 55% to 65% and tightened RSV bands so that 1.5–2x differences in RSV translate into materially larger score gaps.",
        "Introduced explicit per-capita competition metrics (direct outlets per 10,000 effective users) in the Saturation dimension, so high-volume CBDs are penalised relative to their user base rather than only by raw outlet counts.",
        "Weakened automatic penalties for dense but healthy high-volume clusters and clarified that extreme low scores on Saturation should be reserved for clear structural oversupply with weak units.",
        "Added stronger cross-location guardrails so that when RSV differs by 1.5–2x or more, both the Effective Node Volume sub-score and the final scores must differ by minimum amounts in the correct direction.",
        "Clarified application rules requiring all reports to base Effective Node Volume on 0–50 m flows by daypart and to treat time-radius and station-level numbers only as supporting context.",
        "Refined caps based on low RSV and extreme anchor presence so they moderate but do not fully override the effect of very high effective traffic."
