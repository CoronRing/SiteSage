    "customer_rubric": "# Customer Potential Rubric (Further Revised, Location-Oriented, Commuter-Focused)\n\nPurpose: Score 0–10 based on the strength of the realistically reachable customer base and how well it matches the specific store type and its key earning dayparts.\n\n## Fixed top-level category weights for commuter-focused coffee\n\nThese weights are mandatory for this concept and must be identical across all locations:\n- Customer: 25%\n- Traffic: 55%\n- Competition: 20%\n\nHard rules:\n- Analysts must not reweight these categories per site. Scoring tools should hard-code these weights and reject alternative weightings.\n- If scoring metadata for any site shows different top-level weights, the assessment is invalid and must be corrected before comparisons are made.\n\n---\n\n## Sub-dimension weights for Customer (sum = 100%)\n\n1. Population density and catchment strength – 10%\n2. Demographic and spending fit – 10%\n3. Customer behavior, daypart and peak demand – 70%\n4. Opportunities and risks – 10%\n\nRationale: For formats where a large share of sales is expected in a narrow time window (for example 7:00–10:00 for commuter coffee), the number of target customers who are actually present and reachable in that window is far more important than 24-hour averages. The daypart and peak-demand sub-score therefore dominates the customer category and must clearly separate sites whose reachable peak bases differ materially.\n\nAnalyst requirement for comparability (hard):\n- For each site and for the same concept, you must calculate and show a single point estimate (with a documented range) of the reachable peak base in the key window (for example, the number of target persons who can buy in the key 2–3 hour window with ≤3 minutes detour from their natural path and with all required entrances open).\n- Use the same time window, geography and method for all sites being compared.\n- This number must appear in a summary table and be referenced when scoring both the \"customer behavior, daypart and peak demand\" sub-dimension and the main traffic-volume sub-dimension.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Population density and catchment strength (10%)\n\nEvaluate both residential and daytime or visitor population within a practical catchment, typically 5–10 minutes' walk (≈300–800 m) in dense urban areas.\n\nConsider:\n- Residential headcount by consistent radii using the same data source across sites.\n- Daytime and visitor populations: office workers commuting in, students, shoppers, tourists, commuters, park or attraction visitors.\n- The node's functional role: local center, district hub, or city-level hub.\n\nThis is the maximum addressable headcount before adjusting for timing, behavior, and access.\n\n### Excellent (9–10)\n\n9.5–10.0 (city-level super-hub)\n- Within roughly 10 minutes' walk at least one of:\n  - Residents ≥80k plus strong daytime inflow (major offices and at least two large malls or complexes), or\n  - Estimated average daytime plus visitor population ≥300k.\n- Clear role as a city-scale destination (for example multiple metro or rail lines intersecting, or major transit hub integrated with large commercial or office complexes).\n\n9.0–9.4 (strong district hub)\n- Within roughly 10 minutes' walk at least one of:\n  - Residents ≈40k–80k, or\n  - Daytime plus visitors ≈150k–300k.\n\n### Good (7–8.9)\n\n8.0–8.9 (strong neighborhood or sub-center)\n- Residents ≈20k–40k and/or daytime plus visitors ≈80k–150k.\n\n7.0–7.9 (solid local catchment)\n- Residents ≈10k–25k and/or daytime plus visitors ≈40k–80k.\n\n### Adequate (5–6.9)\n\n- Residents ≈5k–15k and/or daytime plus visitors ≈20k–40k.\n\n### Poor (3–4.9)\n\n- Residents <5k and daytime plus visitors <20k, or very thin or dispersed population with weak anchors.\n\n### Insufficient (0–2.9)\n\n- Extremely sparse or intermittent population, unlikely to sustain a mainstream cafe or quick-service unit.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Demographic and spending fit (10%)\n\nEvaluate how well age, income, lifestyle, and spending patterns match the format.\n\nConsider:\n- Age mix and share of working-age adults who are relevant for the category.\n- Income proxies: office grade, housing values, brand mix in nearby malls, presence of premium versus value chains.\n- Lifestyle and category habits: coffee penetration among white-collar workers, tourist food and beverage spending, and similar factors.\n\n### Excellent (9–10)\n\n- Target customer groups by age, income and lifestyle are a clear majority (about 60% or more of reachable population), and\n- Strong evidence of current spend in the category (for example multiple healthy comparables, visible queues in relevant dayparts, premium brand mix).\n\n### Good (7–8.9)\n\n- Target segments are large but mixed with less relevant groups.\n- Spending power and lifestyle broadly favorable with only minor mismatches.\n\n### Adequate (5–6.9)\n\n- Relevant segments exist but do not dominate, or incomes are mixed; concept may need price or assortment adjustments.\n\n### Poor (3–4.9)\n\n- Target segments are a minority; most locals cannot afford or are not interested in the category.\n\n### Insufficient (0–2.9)\n\n- Demographics are fundamentally misaligned with the format.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Customer behavior, daypart and peak demand (70%)\n\nAssess recurring demand, daypart alignment, and realistic peak reach for the storefront itself, not just for the wider node.\n\nFocus on the primary earning window (for example 7:00–10:00 for commuter coffee). The score must scale with relative differences in reachable peak base between sites.\n\nDefinition of reachable peak base:\n- Count target persons present in the key window who can realistically reach the storefront with:\n  - ≤10 minutes total walk from origin or transit, and\n  - ≤3 minutes extra detour off their natural path, and\n  - Open entrances and corridors in that window.\n\nRevised numeric baseline for high-frequency formats (coffee, quick service, convenience), using the estimated reachable peak base for the key 2–3 hour window:\n- <500 relevant people: score 0.0–5.5\n- 500–1,500: 5.5–7.0\n- 1,500–3,000: 7.0–7.8\n- 3,000–6,000: 7.9–8.6\n- 6,000–10,000: 8.7–9.2\n- 10,000–16,000: 9.3–9.7\n- >16,000: 9.8–10.0 (reserved for clearly city-scale super-hubs where the storefront is on or immediately beside primary flows and access is verified in the key window).\n\nInterpretation examples (guidance, not a substitute for counting):\n- A three-line CBD interchange with 250k–300k+ daily passengers, 60k–100k nearby office workers, and a mall or podium entrance within ≈150–250 m that lies on key station-to-office paths will almost always fall in the 10,000–16,000 or >16,000 band.\n- A large suburban hub with 150k–250k daily passengers, 3k–8k nearby office workers, and a satellite mall 400–650 m from the station with partial commuter penetration will more typically fall into the 3,000–10,000 bands, depending on corridor integration and mall-opening hours.\n\nTransit-feed guidance for reachable peak base (to reduce analyst subjectivity):\n- When a significant share of the reachable peak base comes from a rail or metro station, start from average weekday entries plus exits in the key window and apply a default capture fraction based on distance and integration between main exits and the project, then adjust with observed data where available.\n- As a default starting point for commuters in the key window (for example 7:00–10:00):\n  - Storefront in-station concourse or directly on a station-linked concourse: assume 40–70% of relevant line flows in that window pass within potential reach.\n  - Storefront in a building directly connected to main exits by a short, sheltered passage and within roughly 0–200 m of those exits: assume 20–40% of station flows.\n  - Storefront in an adjacent block or mall 200–400 m from main exits, with natural desire lines passing through: assume 10–25%.\n  - Storefront in a nearby mall or block 400–700 m away without full physical integration: assume 5–15%.\n  - Storefront further than roughly 700 m or requiring two or more crossings of wide roads or plazas: assume <10% even in dense nodes.\n- These fractions are starting anchors; analysts should override them only with explicit corridor or mobile data, and must apply the same logic across all sites.\n\nRelative-scaling rule for peak reach between locations (hard constraint):\n- When comparing two candidate sites for the same concept and city, using the same method for reachable peak base:\n  - If site A's reachable peak base is ≥1.5 times site B's, their daypart or peak-demand sub-scores must differ by at least 1.8 points and their overall customer scores by at least 1.2 points.\n  - If A is ≥2 times B, daypart or peak-demand must differ by at least 2.7 points and overall customer by at least 2.0 points.\n  - If A is ≥3 times B, daypart or peak-demand must differ by at least 3.5 points and overall customer by at least 2.7 points, unless there is a clearly documented structural risk at A (for example unreliable access during the key window) that does not exist at B.\n- If these gaps are not met, the analyst must either revise the underlying peak-base estimates or rescore; smoothing scores to be closer without changing inputs is not allowed.\n\nSuper-hub floor:\n- In large cities, if a site has all of the following:\n  - A multi-line metro interchange or equivalent with ≥250k–300k daily passengers within roughly 200 m of the project, and\n  - ≥50k office workers or students within roughly 600 m, and\n  - A storefront lying on key desire lines between station and offices with open access in the primary window,\nthen this sub-score should normally be ≥9.3. When such super-hubs are compared with smaller nodes, use the relative-scaling rule to express differences in the 9.3–10.0 band.\n\nDaypart share caps:\n- If <35–40% of relevant node traffic is present and able to access the storefront in the key earning window, cap this sub-score at 8.0 even in a busy all-day district.\n- If <25–30% is present or can access the storefront then, cap at 7.5.\n\nAccess-hours caps (revised):\n- If corridors or entrances necessary to reach the storefront are closed or materially restricted during more than half of the primary earning window, first estimate the score ignoring this restriction based on reachable peak base, then reduce it by 1.5–2.5 points (capped at 7.5). Document the adjustment explicitly.\n- If such access is uncertain but critical (for example interior mall locations targeting 7:00–10:00 with no confirmed early-opening policy), provisionally reduce the unconstrained score by 1.0–1.5 points and cap it at 8.0, rather than forcing all such sites to the same fixed ceiling. Apply the same reduction logic to all comparable sites so that relative advantages are not erased.\n\nQualitative bands (used together with numeric rules):\n\nExcellent (9–10)\n- Clear, strong alignment of presence and behavior in the key daypart; dense, repeat office and commuter flows with open access 7:00–10:00 and minimal detour.\n\nGood (7–8.9)\n- Demand patterns in the key window are at or moderately above network average; similar stores perform solidly.\n\nAdequate (5–6.9)\n- Some demand in the key window but modest or partially misaligned with the concept.\n\nPoor (3–4.9)\n- Weak or irregular demand in key dayparts.\n\nInsufficient (0–2.9)\n- No clear demand pattern in the key daypart.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Opportunities and risks (10%)\n\nConsider the likely future direction of the reachable customer base and structural risks affecting it.\n\nLook at:\n- Planned office or residential projects, new transit, mall upgrades, and repositioning.\n- Risk of losing anchors (employers, major tenants), long-term disruptive construction, regulatory changes.\n\nExcellent (9–10)\n- Strong visible growth drivers benefiting key segments and dayparts with no major downside risks.\n\nGood (7–8.9)\n- Net positive outlook: some growth or upgrades, manageable risks.\n\nAdequate (5–6.9)\n- Neutral or uncertain; no strong growth or shrinkage expected.\n\nPoor (3–4.9)\n- Noticeable structural risks with limited offsetting upsides.\n\nInsufficient (0–2.9)\n- High likelihood of significant deterioration in customer base or suitability.\n",
    "traffic_rubric": "# Traffic and Accessibility Rubric (Further Revised, Location-Oriented, Commuter-Focused)\n\nPurpose: Score 0–10 based on how easily and naturally target customers reach and pass the storefront, and the magnitude and timing of those flows. Emphasis is on storefront-level access and pass-by, not just node-wide transit volumes.\n\n## Fixed top-level category weights for commuter-focused coffee\n\nThese weights are mandatory for this concept and must be the same for all locations:\n- Traffic: 55%\n- Customer: 25%\n- Competition: 20%\n\nAnalysts may not change these weights per site. Tools should enforce them.\n\n---\n\n## Sub-dimension weights for Traffic (sum = 100%)\n\n1. Public transit and connectivity quality – 5%\n2. Walkability, parking and road access – 10%\n3. Target customer mobility fit – 10%\n4. Traffic volume and temporal benefits – 75%\n\nRationale: Many urban locations have acceptable transit and walkability. What differentiates commuter formats is how much peak-hour traffic actually passes within a few steps of the door, when that happens, and how well it overlaps with target users. The traffic-volume-and-temporal sub-score therefore carries most of the weight and must strongly separate super-hubs with direct storefront exposure from smaller nodes or off-flow positions.\n\nAnalyst requirement (hard):\n- For each site and for the same concept, estimate corridor-level pass-by in the key window (for example pedestrians per hour passing within roughly 0–30 m of the frontage during the 7:00–10:00 window) using counts, mobile data, or consistent benchmarks.\n- Use the same logic, time window and assumptions for all sites in a comparison and document this number in a summary table.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Public transit and connectivity quality (5%)\n\nEvaluate potential inflow to the immediate area from metro or rail and major buses, before micro-routing inside buildings.\n\nConsider:\n- Number of lines and modes.\n- Distance from key exits or hubs to the overall project or building.\n- Daily passenger throughput.\n\nExcellent (9–10)\n\n9.5–10.0 (top-tier city transit hubs, directly integrated)\n- Three or more metro or rail lines, or metro plus a major intercity or bus hub.\n- At least one major entrance or concourse is inside the project or within roughly 0–50 m, with high-capacity, sheltered paths.\n- In a large city, daily passenger throughput ≈250k–300k or more.\n\n9.0–9.4 (strong multi-line or regional nodes)\n- Two or more high-frequency metro lines, or one metro line plus a dense bus hub, with main exits within about 0–300 m.\n- In a large city, daily passenger throughput ≈120k–250k.\n\nDistance and integration caps (hard):\n- If the nearest heavy-use rail exit is >300 m from the project, cap this sub-score at 8.5 even if station volumes are high.\n- If >400 m, cap at 7.8.\n- If >600 m, cap at 7.0.\n- If close to a large station but not physically connected and requiring unsheltered crossings of wide arterials or open plazas, cap at 9.0 even if distance is shorter.\n\nGood (7–8.9)\n- Solid transit: one major metro line or bus rapid transit within roughly 300–500 m plus multiple bus routes, or smaller multi-line nodes with ≈20k–120k daily passengers.\n\nAdequate (5–6.9)\n- Basic coverage: one line or a few routes within roughly 500–800 m and ≈5k–20k daily passengers.\n\nPoor (3–4.9)\n- Sparse or inconvenient transit for target users.\n\nInsufficient (0–2.9)\n- Minimal transit access.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Walkability, parking and road access (10%)\n\nAssess pedestrian quality, vehicle access, and approach simplicity.\n\nConsider:\n- Sidewalk continuity, safety, and directness of typical desire lines.\n- Shelter or weather protection for key flows.\n- Parking supply and ease where relevant, and clarity of car access.\n\nExcellent (9–10)\n- Safe, continuous sidewalks; natural desire lines pass directly by the storefront.\n- Multiple barrier-free entries; good shelter from rain, heat and cold for main flows.\n- Sufficient parking within roughly 3–5 minutes' walk and simple car access if drivers are a meaningful segment.\n\nGood (7–8.9)\n- Generally good walking conditions with minor flaws; adequate parking within about 5–8 minutes or workable short-stop options.\n\nAdequate (5–6.9)\n- Mixed: some indirect or fragmented walkways, awkward but usable parking, or minor safety concerns.\n\nPoor (3–4.9)\n- Difficult walking (dangerous crossings, missing sidewalks) or very limited parking in a car-dependent context.\n\nInsufficient (0–2.9)\n- Major physical or regulatory barriers severely limit reachability.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Target customer mobility fit (10%)\n\nHow well actual access modes and micro-routes match how target customers travel between transit, parking, offices, homes, and the store.\n\nConsider:\n- Typical station-to-office, home-to-station, parking-to-office, or campus paths.\n- Extra detour time required to reach the storefront.\n- Overlap between key flows and store operating hours.\n\nExcellent (9–10)\n- Dominant travel modes are directly and conveniently served:\n  - For metro office commuters: key exits and walking routes run past or beside the storefront within roughly 150 m, preferably on the shortest paths between station and office clusters.\n  - For car users where relevant: parking in the same project or adjacent, with simple vertical circulation to the store level.\n- For most target users, extra detour versus their natural path is ≤3 minutes, often ≈0–2 minutes.\n- Main flows in critical hours coincide with open, accessible entries and corridors.\n\nCommuter caps (hard):\n- For commuter-dependent formats, if more than half of relevant commuters must detour >4 minutes off their station-to-office or home-to-station routes, cap this sub-score at 7.5.\n- If more than half must detour >6 minutes, cap at 6.5.\n\nGood (7–8.9)\n- Mostly aligned; typical detours ≈3–5 minutes for major segments, with straightforward routing and limited friction.\n\nAdequate (5–6.9)\n- Partial alignment: some key segments are well served; others require 5–10 minute detours, awkward transfers, or unclear routing.\n\nPoor (3–4.9)\n- Major target segments face significant friction.\n\nInsufficient (0–2.9)\n- Access patterns are clearly misaligned with how likely customers travel.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Traffic volume and temporal benefits (75%)\n\nEvaluate how much usable traffic actually passes near the storefront (roughly 0–30 m) and whether it aligns with key dayparts.\n\nUse quantitative or reasoned estimates based on manual counts, mobile data near the frontage, or well-anchored benchmarks. For commuter coffee and similar formats, focus on pedestrians during the main 2–3 hour peak window.\n\nRevised numeric guide for storefront-level peak pass-by (key 2–3 hour window):\n- Peak <300 people per hour and daily pass-by <3k: score 0.0–5.5.\n- 300–800 people per hour and daily 3k–10k: 5.5–6.9.\n- 800–1,500 people per hour and daily 10k–25k: 7.0–8.0.\n- 1,500–2,500 people per hour and daily 25k–40k: 8.1–8.8.\n- 2,500–4,000 people per hour and daily 40k–65k: 8.9–9.4.\n- 4,000–6,000 people per hour and daily 65k–90k: 9.5–9.8.\n- >6,000 people per hour and daily ≥90k–120k+: 9.9–10.0 (only if clearly on a primary spine or exit used in the key daypart).\n\nStation-to-corridor conversion guidance (to link node volumes to storefront pass-by):\n- When a major share of pass-by depends on a nearby transit hub, convert station totals into estimated corridor flows before scoring:\n  - Estimate passengers in the key window (for example 7:00–10:00) by applying a time-of-day share (often 25–35% of daily entries plus exits in large Chinese metros).\n  - Apply a default share of those passengers to the specific corridor on which the storefront sits, based on distance and integration, using the same fractions as in the customer rubric's transit-feed guidance (for example 20–40% for directly connected 0–200 m buildings, 5–15% for 400–700 m satellite malls).\n  - Cross-check this with any observed corridor counts; if they differ materially, reconcile the assumptions and document the final estimate.\n\nRelative-scaling rule for storefront pass-by between locations (hard constraint):\n- For two sites for the same format and city, using the same pass-by method and time window:\n  - If site A's estimated storefront-level pass-by in the key window is ≥1.5 times site B's, this sub-score must differ by at least 1.8 points and overall traffic scores by at least 1.2 points.\n  - If A is ≥2 times B, this sub-score must differ by at least 2.7 points and overall traffic scores by at least 2.0 points.\n  - If A is ≥3 times B, this sub-score must differ by at least 3.5 points and overall traffic scores by at least 2.7 points, unless A has clearly documented access issues not present at B.\n- If these gaps are not met, revisit the pass-by estimates or rescore; do not compress differences without changing inputs.\n\nDaypart alignment rule:\n- If corridor traffic peaks mostly outside the format's key daypart (for example late-night tourists instead of morning commuters), cap this sub-score at 8.0 even if daily flows are high.\n\nInterior-complex and early-opening rules (revised):\n- For malls and office interiors, base scores on corridor tier and estimated corridor flows, not on whole-mall traffic:\n  - Main spines directly linking key entrances, stations and anchors with visibly heavy flows can reach 9.0 or above if numeric levels justify it.\n  - Side corridors, upper floors without anchors, or spaces shielded from main desire lines should typically be ≤8.0 unless data show flows comparable to main spines.\n- If internal corridors or main gates feeding the storefront are closed or effectively unused for more than half of the primary earning window, first estimate the unconstrained score based on corridor flows and then reduce it by 1.5–2.5 points, with a hard ceiling of 7.5.\n- If early access to a mall or podium is uncertain but critical to morning trade, provisionally reduce the unconstrained score by 1.0–1.5 points and cap it at 8.0, instead of forcing all such sites to the same fixed maximum. Apply the same adjustment rule across all sites in a comparison so relative differences in underlying traffic are preserved.\n\nTransit-node caution:\n- When a mall or complex is near a major station but not physically integrated into the station concourse, assume only a fraction (often ≈10–30%) of station passengers enter the building in commuter peaks. Use this reduced base to estimate storefront pass-by.\n- Only grant the top two bands (9.5 and above here) when there is clear evidence that the storefront is on a main station-to-office spine or in-station concourse, not merely in a nearby complex.\n\nQualitative bands (used with numeric rules):\n\nExcellent (9–10)\n- Storefront lies directly on a primary pedestrian flow (station exit concourse, main mall spine between major anchors, or primary high-street corner) with strong volumes in relevant hours.\n\nGood (7–8.9)\n- Storefront is close to but not perfectly on a main corridor, or traffic is strong but concentrated in fewer windows.\n\nAdequate (5–6.9)\n- Moderate pass-by: side corridors, secondary streets, or upper floors with some draw.\n\nPoor (3–4.9)\n- Limited passing traffic, such as rear streets or deep interior corners.\n\nInsufficient (0–2.9)\n- Very low visible traffic near the site, heavily destination-only.\n",
    "competition_rubric": "# Competition and Positioning Rubric (Further Revised, Location-Oriented)\n\nPurpose: Score 0–10 on net competitive favorability: density, saturation, differentiation room, and risk. High-traffic hubs can still have modest competition scores, but competition should not fully overturn large advantages in customer and traffic unless there is clear evidence of over-supply and underperformance.\n\n## Fixed top-level category weights\n\nFor commuter-focused coffee and similar fast-service formats:\n- Competition: 20%\n- Traffic: 55%\n- Customer: 25%\n\nWeights are fixed by format and must be applied identically across all locations. Do not adjust them per site.\n\n---\n\n## Sub-dimension weights for Competition (sum = 100%)\n\n1. Competitor density and micro-proximity – 20%\n2. Market saturation versus demand – 30%\n3. Positioning opportunity – 25%\n4. Competitive risk – 25%\n\nRationale: Saturation versus demand is a core economic driver, but in dense hubs some saturation is normal. Positioning opportunity and competitive risk together capture whether a new concept can still win. Ratings should strongly penalize hyper-clusters only when per-store volumes are likely to be weak.\n\nHigh-demand hub floor (cross-check, tightened):\n- In locations where both customer and traffic category scores are ≥8.5, the overall competition score should rarely be below 5.0 unless there is specific evidence of over-supply (for example quiet peers in prime positions in key dayparts, frequent closures, or extreme discounting). This prevents competition from completely negating genuine super-hub advantages without clear justification.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Competitor density and micro-proximity (20%)\n\nAssess direct substitutes within roughly 300–800 m, focusing on:\n- How many are on the same primary micro-flows (same concourse, corridor, or short block), and\n- Distances to the closest direct competitors (≤25 m, 25–100 m, 100–300 m, >300 m).\n\nExcellent (9–10)\n- Light or balanced competition:\n  - Five or fewer direct competitors within roughly 500 m, and\n  - No major direct competitor within 100 m on the same main path.\n\nGood (7–8.9)\n- Several competitors within roughly 500 m (about 6–15), but not tightly clustered on the same micro-flow; at most one direct substitute within 50 m.\n\nAdequate (5–6.9)\n- Noticeable density, including direct substitutes in the same building or within 100–300 m, but demand clearly supports multiple players and the new concept has plausible differentiation.\n- Typical of busy central business districts and transit hubs where many operators coexist and seem reasonably healthy.\n\nHub guideline:\n- In strong hubs where customer and traffic both score ≥8.5 and most peers appear busy in relevant dayparts, dense supply often justifies scores between roughly 5.5 and 7.5. Use scores <5.0 only where micro-clustering is clearly extreme.\n\nPoor (3–4.9)\n- High density of near-identical competitors tightly clustered on the same micro-flows:\n  - Three or more direct substitutes within 50 m on the same corridor or entrance, or\n  - Five or more within 100 m on the same primary desire line.\n- Best-visible positions mostly occupied by incumbents, leaving marginal exposure for the new store.\n\nHard rules:\n- If there is at least one flagship or large-format direct competitor (for example a reserve or hero unit) and at least two other direct substitutes within 50 m on the same path, this sub-score should usually be 4.0 or lower, even in high-demand hubs.\n\nInterior-mall hyper-cluster rule (for coffee, tea and similar beverages):\n- If, inside the same mall or podium block and within roughly 150 m, there are four or more branded chain coffee or tea units plus three or more bakery or dessert cafes offering similar beverages, then:\n  - Competitor density should usually be ≤3.5, and\n  - Competitive risk (section 4) should usually be ≤4.0, unless strong evidence shows chronic unmet demand and very high per-store volumes.\n\nInsufficient (0–2.9)\n- Severe clustering of direct substitutes and clear signs that new entrants struggle despite good traffic.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Market saturation versus demand (30%)\n\nMatch aggregate category supply to aggregate demand, emphasizing realistic per-store volume for the category and node.\n\nConsider:\n- Busy or quiet patterns for comparable stores across day and week.\n- Rough category demand versus number of outlets (for example estimated cups per day versus number of cafes in the catchment).\n- Discounting intensity and unit churn (openings and closures).\n\nExcellent (9–10)\n- Clear unmet demand:\n  - Frequent queues or lack of capacity at multiple incumbents outside holidays.\n  - Peak times show customers turned away or enduring long waits without heavy discounting.\n\nGood (7–8.9)\n- Supply and demand are favorable:\n  - Existing stores generally busy and healthy in relevant times.\n  - Room for additional entrants, especially with differentiation or new daypart focus.\n\nAdequate (5–6.9)\n- Rough balance between supply and demand:\n  - Many operators are steady but not stretched; some busy, some average.\n  - Discounts or promotions common but not extreme; limited churn.\n- New entrants must take share and/or carve a clear niche.\n\nHyper-density check for high-frequency categories (coffee, tea, quick service):\n- If there are ≥20 direct outlets within roughly 250 m or ≥60 within roughly 500 m, and not all appear very busy in key dayparts, this sub-score should usually be in the 3.0–5.0 band.\n- Only raise above 5.0 when there is strong evidence that per-outlet demand remains well above network norms.\n\nPoor (3–4.9)\n- Signs of existing or emerging over-supply:\n  - Several clearly under-utilized operators in good positions, especially in key dayparts.\n  - Frequent deep discounting and visible churn of similar concepts.\n\nInsufficient (0–2.9)\n- Market appears fully saturated or shrinking; many underperformers and frequent closures despite good locations.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Positioning opportunity (25%)\n\nAssess room to differentiate on dimensions customers value: price, quality, speed, assortment, experience, or daypart focus.\n\nExcellent (9–10)\n- Clear, sizable white spaces such as:\n  - Missing price tiers (for example no mid-priced quality option between premium and value chains).\n  - Missing formats (for example no express commuter kiosk at a busy exit, or no serious specialty option in a value-heavy cluster).\n  - Underserved dayparts (for example early morning in a node where most cafes open late).\n\nGood (7–8.9)\n- Several credible differentiation angles; the concept can plausibly become best-in-class on at least one important dimension (fastest, best coffee, healthiest, most convenient) even in a crowded area.\n\nAdequate (5–6.9)\n- Limited but real differentiation room; obvious positions (cheap versus standard versus premium, fast versus slow, sit-down versus takeaway) are mostly taken. Success depends more on superior execution than on a structural white space.\n\nPoor (3–4.9)\n- Hard to stand out: most obvious positions are strongly owned by entrenched brands with high loyalty and similar formats.\n\nInsufficient (0–2.9)\n- No credible positioning space: all key niches are saturated with powerful incumbents and there is little sign of customer dissatisfaction.\n\nClustered-mall adjustment:\n- In interior malls where several strong chains already anchor the main commuter or shopping corridors at similar tiers, apply a downward tilt of about 0.5–1.0 points to positioning opportunity relative to a street node with the same brands but looser spacing, unless there is clear white space in daypart, speed, or price tier.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Competitive risk (25%)\n\nEvaluate risk from incumbents' brand power, resources, landlord relationships, and likely reactions.\n\nConsider:\n- Presence of dominant chains or flagships at similar price and quality tiers.\n- Landlord or anchor relationships that may favor incumbents (visibility, signage, renewal priority).\n- Likely competitive responses (discounting, loyalty programs, corporate deals, rapid copying).\n\nExcellent (9–10)\n- Competitive risk low: most nearby operators are complementary or target different segments or occasions, or are significantly weaker on brand, product, or access.\n\nGood (7–8.9)\n- Some pressure but manageable; strong brands exist but overlap is partial (different dayparts, formats, or price tiers).\n\nAdequate (5–6.9)\n- Clear competitive risks from strong brands within roughly 100–200 m, but not overwhelming; responses likely but survivable with good execution and differentiation.\n\nPoor (3–4.9)\n- High competitive risk:\n  - Multiple strong incumbents in close proximity (about 50–100 m) with similar offers and overlapping peak dayparts.\n  - Likely aggressive defense (heavy coupons, corporate deals, landlord support) making it hard to build share.\n\nHard rules:\n- If a flagship or hero unit of a top competitor (for example a reserve or iconic cafe) is in the same building or within roughly 25 m of the entrance and targets nearly identical use cases, this sub-score should usually be 4.5 or lower.\n- In interior malls where several strong chains already anchor the main commuter corridors at similar tiers, apply a downward tilt of about 0.5–1.0 points to both competitive risk and positioning opportunity versus a comparable street node.\n\nInsufficient (0–2.9)\n- Extremely high-risk environment with dominant incumbents, strong landlord ties, and history of aggressive defense; new entry is structurally very high risk.\n"
