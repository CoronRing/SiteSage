# Competition and Positioning Rubric

Purpose: Score 0–10 on net competitive favorability: density, saturation, differentiation room, and risk. High-traffic hubs can still have modest competition scores, but competition should not fully overturn large advantages in customer and traffic unless there is clear evidence of over-supply and underperformance.

## Sub-dimension weights for Competition (sum = 100%)

1. Competitor density and micro-proximity – 20%
2. Market saturation versus demand – 30%
3. Positioning opportunity – 25%
4. Competitive risk – 25%

## 1. Competitor density and micro-proximity (20%)

Assess direct substitutes within roughly 500 m, focusing on:
- How many are on the same primary micro-flows (same concourse, corridor, or short block), and
- Distances to the closest direct competitors (≤25 m, 25–100 m, 100–300 m, >300 m).

### Excellent (9–10)
- Light or balanced competition:
  - Five or fewer direct competitors within roughly 500 m, and
  - No major direct competitor within 100 m on the same main path.

### Good (7–8.9)
- Several competitors within roughly 500 m (about 6–15), but not tightly clustered on the same micro-flow; at most one direct substitute within 50 m.

### Adequate (5–6.9)
- Noticeable density, including direct substitutes in the same building or within 100–300 m, but demand clearly supports multiple players and the new concept has plausible differentiation.
- Typical of busy central business districts and transit hubs where many operators coexist and seem reasonably healthy.

Hub guideline:
- In strong hubs where customer and traffic both score ≥8.5 and most peers appear busy in relevant dayparts, dense supply often justifies scores between roughly 5.5 and 7.5. Use scores <5.0 only where micro-clustering is clearly extreme.

### Poor (3–4.9)
- High density of near-identical competitors tightly clustered on the same micro-flows:
  - Three or more direct substitutes within 50 m on the same corridor or entrance, or
  - Five or more within 100 m on the same primary desire line.
- Best-visible positions mostly occupied by incumbents, leaving marginal exposure for the new store.

**Hard rules**:
- If there is at least one flagship or large-format direct competitor (for example a reserve or hero unit) and at least two other direct substitutes within 50 m on the same path, this sub-score should usually be 4.0 or lower, even in high-demand hubs.

**Interior-mall hyper-cluster rule** (for coffee, tea and similar beverages):
- If, inside the same mall or podium block and within roughly 150 m, there are four or more branded chain coffee or tea units plus three or more bakery or dessert cafes offering similar beverages, then:
  - Competitor density should usually be ≤3.5, and
  - Competitive risk (section 4) should usually be ≤4.0, unless strong evidence shows chronic unmet demand and very high per-store volumes.

### Insufficient (0–2.9)
- Severe clustering of direct substitutes and clear signs that new entrants struggle despite good traffic.

## 2. Market saturation versus demand (30%)

Match aggregate category supply to aggregate demand, emphasizing realistic per-store volume for the category and node.

### Excellent (9–10)
- Clear unmet demand:
  - Frequent queues or lack of capacity at multiple incumbents outside holidays.
  - Peak times show customers turned away or enduring long waits without heavy discounting.

### Good (7–8.9)
- Supply and demand are favorable:
  - Existing stores generally busy and healthy in relevant times.
  - Room for additional entrants, especially with differentiation or new daypart focus.

### Adequate (5–6.9)
- Rough balance between supply and demand:
  - Many operators are steady but not stretched; some busy, some average.
  - Discounts or promotions common but not extreme; limited churn.
- New entrants must take share and/or carve a clear niche.

Hyper-density check for high-frequency categories (coffee, tea, quick service):
- If there are ≥20 direct outlets within roughly 250 m or ≥60 within roughly 500 m, and not all appear very busy in key dayparts, this sub-score should usually be in the 3.0–5.0 band.
- Only raise above 5.0 when there is strong evidence that per-outlet demand remains well above network norms.

### Poor (3–4.9)
- Signs of existing or emerging over-supply:
  - Several clearly under-utilized operators in good positions, especially in key dayparts.
  - Frequent deep discounting and visible churn of similar concepts.

### Insufficient (0–2.9)
- Market appears fully saturated or shrinking; many underperformers and frequent closures despite good locations.

---

## 3. Positioning opportunity (25%)

Assess room to differentiate on dimensions customers value: price, quality, speed, assortment, experience, or daypart focus.

### Excellent (9–10)
- Clear, sizable white spaces such as:
  - Missing price tiers (for example no mid-priced quality option between premium and value chains).
  - Missing formats (for example no express commuter kiosk at a busy exit, or no serious specialty option in a value-heavy cluster).
  - Underserved dayparts (for example early morning in a node where most cafes open late).

### Good (7–8.9)
- Several credible differentiation angles; the concept can plausibly become best-in-class on at least one important dimension (fastest, best coffee, healthiest, most convenient) even in a crowded area.

### Adequate (5–6.9)
- Limited but real differentiation room; obvious positions (cheap versus standard versus premium, fast versus slow, sit-down versus takeaway) are mostly taken. Success depends more on superior execution than on a structural white space.

### Poor (3–4.9)
- Hard to stand out: most obvious positions are strongly owned by entrenched brands with high loyalty and similar formats.

### Insufficient (0–2.9)
- No credible positioning space: all key niches are saturated with powerful incumbents and there is little sign of customer dissatisfaction.

**Clustered-mall adjustment**:
- In interior malls where several strong chains already anchor the main commuter or shopping corridors at similar tiers, apply a downward tilt of about 0.5–1.0 points to positioning opportunity relative to a street node with the same brands but looser spacing, unless there is clear white space in daypart, speed, or price tier.

---

## 4. Competitive risk (25%)

Evaluate risk from incumbents' brand power, resources, landlord relationships, and likely reactions.

### Excellent (9–10)
- Competitive risk low: most nearby operators are complementary or target different segments or occasions, or are significantly weaker on brand, product, or access.

### Good (7–8.9)
- Some pressure but manageable; strong brands exist but overlap is partial (different dayparts, formats, or price tiers).

### Adequate (5–6.9)
- Clear competitive risks from strong brands within roughly 100–200 m, but not overwhelming; responses likely but survivable with good execution and differentiation.

### Poor (3–4.9)
- High competitive risk:
  - Multiple strong incumbents in close proximity (about 50–100 m) with similar offers and overlapping peak dayparts.
  - Likely aggressive defense (heavy coupons, corporate deals, landlord support) making it hard to build share.

**Hard rules**:
- If a flagship or hero unit of a top competitor (for example a reserve or iconic cafe) is in the same building or within roughly 25 m of the entrance and targets nearly identical use cases, this sub-score should usually be 4.5 or lower.
- In interior malls where several strong chains already anchor the main commuter corridors at similar tiers, apply a downward tilt of about 0.5–1.0 points to both competitive risk and positioning opportunity versus a comparable street node.

### Insufficient (0–2.9)
- Extremely high-risk environment with dominant incumbents, strong landlord ties, and history of aggressive defense; new entry is structurally very high risk.
