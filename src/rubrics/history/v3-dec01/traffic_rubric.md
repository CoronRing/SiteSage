Traffic & Accessibility Rubric

Purpose
- Score each location 0–10 based only on traffic & accessibility for a weekday-morning, commuter-focused specialty coffee shop.
- Output score is a weighted average of sub-dimensions (0–10 each). Weights sum to 100%.
- Emphasis is on: *actual* morning pass-by at the storefront, how on‑path the store is, and the size/quality of captive office populations.

Weights (sum 100%)
- A. Effective morning pass‑by at storefront (0–30 m) – **38%**
- B. Commuter detour & path fit – **15%**
- C. Commuter composition & peak-hour alignment – **10%**
- D. Macro transit relevance & capture – **10%**
- E. Surrounding employment & resident density (1 km) – **8%**
- F. Captive on-site / same-complex population – **12%**
- G. In-project visibility & unit placement – **5%**
- H. Car & drop-off accessibility – **2%**

Global caps (apply after weighted average)
- If A (morning pass-by) < 5.0 → overall score ≤ 6.5.
- If A < 4.0 → overall score ≤ 5.5.
- If B (detour & path fit) < 5.0 → overall score ≤ 6.5.
- If C (commuter composition) < 5.0 → overall score ≤ 6.5.
- If D (macro transit relevance & capture) < 5.0 → overall score ≤ 7.5.
- If F (captive on-site population) < 4.0 → overall score ≤ 7.0.
- If G (in-project visibility) < 4.0 → overall score ≤ 7.0.

Scoring bands (all dimensions)
- 9–10: Excellent
- 7–8: Strong
- 5–6: Moderate
- 3–4: Weak
- 0–2: Very weak / poor

A. Effective morning pass‑by at storefront (0–30 m) – 38%
Measure
- Pedestrians passing within ~0–30 m of storefront with clear line-of-sight, 07:00–10:00 on a typical weekday.
- Count only the corridor / entrance where the unit actually sits (not whole mall or distant street segments).
- Use conservative averages over at least 3 normal weekdays.

Scoring (07:00–10:00 unique passers, both directions)
- 9–10: ≥ 30,000 passers; corridor is the primary path for station→office or home→station.
- 8: 20,000–29,999 passers; one of 1–2 dominant commuter paths.
- 7: 14,000–19,999 passers; strong commuter path, clearly on main flows.
- 6: 9,000–13,999 passers; meaningful, steady commuter flow but not the heaviest corridor.
- 5: 6,000–8,999 passers; secondary path with visible but limited morning flow.
- 4: 3,000–5,999 passers; side corridor or partial visibility from main path.
- 2–3: 1,000–2,999 passers; weak, mainly destination usage.
- 0–1: <1,000 passers; very off-peak relative to 07:00–10:00.

Notes
- If internal placement is uncertain, base estimates on the *narrowest* plausible corridor volume, not project-wide or hub-wide figures.

B. Commuter detour & path fit – 15%
Measure
- Extra time vs. shortest path for major commuter groups (by volume): metro→office, home→station, parking→office.
- Use walking speed 70–85 m/min; include level changes, backtracking, crossings and waiting at doors/escalators.

Scoring (focus on ≥70% of relevant commuters)
- 9–10 (Excellent on-path): For ≥70% of key commuters, extra detour ≤ 2 min (≤ ~150 m); no extra road crossings; path is straight and intuitive.
- 7–8 (Strong fit): For ≥60% of key commuters, extra detour 2–4 min (~150–300 m); at most one extra simple crossing or turn.
- 5–6 (Moderate): For ≥50% of key commuters, extra detour 4–7 min (~300–500 m) *or* noticeable friction (multiple turns/levels, bottlenecks).
- 3–4 (Weak): Majority need >7 min extra or clear backtracking away from desire lines.
- 0–2 (Poor): Store is largely off main mobility patterns; few commuters can include it without major detours.

Caps inside B
- If >50% of core commuters would detour >5 min, B ≤ 7.0.
- If >50% would detour >8 min, B ≤ 5.0.

C. Commuter composition & peak-hour alignment – 10%
Measure
- Share of nearby traffic (within ~200 m of project) that is repeat weekday commuters vs. tourists/leisure.
- Strength of 07:00–10:00 and 17:00–19:00 peaks vs. midday/evening.
- How much of total footfall is usable weekday-morning coffee demand.

Scoring
- 9–10 (Commuter-dominant): ≥40% of daily flows occur in peaks (07:00–10:00 + 17:00–19:00); ≥60% of morning passers are repeat commuters/students.
- 7–8 (Commuter-strong mixed): 25–39% of daily flows in peaks; 40–59% of morning passers are regular commuters.
- 5–6 (Balanced / leisure-skewed): 15–24% of daily flows in peaks; commuters a clear minority but still meaningful.
- 3–4 (Leisure-dominant): <15% of daily flows in 07:00–10:00; most traffic is midday/evening/weekend.
- 0–2 (Event/tourist only): Almost no stable commuter base; flows are event/tourist bursts.

Caps inside C
- If area is clearly leisure/tourist-dominant with weak morning peak, C ≤ 6.0 regardless of total volumes.

D. Macro transit relevance & capture – 10%
Measure
- Rail/metro lines and major bus hubs within ~600 m walking of main customer entrances.
- **Relevant station volume** = station entries/exits × estimated share whose shortest on-foot path naturally passes toward the project (within ~400 m of entrances).
- Exclude lines/platforms and station flows whose typical paths lead away from the project.

Scoring (use conservative relevant volumes)
- 9–10 (Super-core captured hub): ≥3 lines within ~600 m *and* relevant volume ≥ 200,000/day *and* at least one major station within ~400 m with direct built-in linkage.
- 7–8 (Strong captured hub): ≥2 lines within ~600 m *and* relevant volume 80,000–199,999/day.
- 5–6 (Moderate): ≥1 line within ~800 m *and* relevant volume 30,000–79,999/day.
- 3–4 (Weak): Only 1 small line beyond ~800 m *or* bus hub 10,000–29,999 relevant users with no strong rail capture.
- 0–2 (Minimal): No meaningful rail within comfortable walk; only minor bus (<10,000 relevant users).

Caps inside D
- If relevant volume <40,000/day, D ≤ 8.0.
- If only 5–20% of a large hub’s flows naturally walk toward the project, cap D at 6.0 even if the hub itself is very large.

E. Surrounding employment & resident density (1 km) – 8%
Measure
- Working-age residents (≈15–64) within ~1 km.
- Daytime employment within ~1 km (office, retail, institutional).
- Avoid double counting; define total base = residents + workers.

Scoring
- 9–10 (Very dense core): Base ≥160,000; at least one segment very strong (≥100,000 workers or ≥90,000 working-age residents).
- 7–8 (Dense urban): Base 90,000–159,999; at least one segment strong (≥60,000 workers or ≥60,000 residents).
- 5–6 (Medium): Base 40,000–89,999.
- 3–4 (Low): Base 15,000–39,999.
- 0–2 (Very low): Base <15,000.

F. Captive on-site / same-complex population – 12%
Measure
- Number of workers and hotel guests directly in the same podium/tower or immediately connected complex (0–100 m indoor walk):
  - Office workers in upstairs towers directly linked to the podium.
  - Hotel guests in the same building/superblock with indoor access.
- Do *not* include wider 1 km area here (that is E).

Scoring (weekday daytime captive base with ≤3-min indoor walk, no road crossings)
- 9–10: ≥15,000 captive workers/guests; project is a primary daily path node (elevators, lobby, transit link).
- 7–8: 7,000–14,999 captive; strong integration but not entire district.
- 5–6: 3,000–6,999 captive; meaningful tower(s) but not very large.
- 3–4: 1,000–2,999 captive; small or partially linked buildings.
- 0–2: <1,000 captive or weak connection (not on typical internal route).

Caps inside F
- If captive base <1,000, F ≤ 2.0.
- If captive base 1,000–2,999, F ≤ 4.0.

G. In-project visibility & unit placement – 5%
Measure
- Whether storefront is on primary desire lines between transit exits, office lobbies, parking cores, and major anchors.
- Line-of-sight distance from main internal spines and entrances used 07:00–10:00.

Scoring
- 9–10 (Prime): Faces main internal spine; visible within ≤20 m from at least one major entrance or transit-linked corridor open 07:00–10:00.
- 7–8 (Strong): ≤30 m offset or one simple turn from main route; strong visibility from key escalators/elevator lobbies; seen by most commuters who traverse the project.
- 5–6 (Moderate): On secondary corridor; requires multiple turns *or* is only visible after entering deeper into mall.
- 3–4 (Weak): Cul-de-sac/upper floor; little organic discovery from transit→office paths.
- 0–2 (Very weak): Not on any realistic commuter path; essentially destination-only.

H. Car & drop-off accessibility – 2%
Measure
- Structured parking spaces within ~3–8 min walk (especially same project/connected complex).
- Ease of legal taxi/ride-hail drop-off within ~50–150 m of main customer entrance.

Scoring
- 9–10 (Excellent): ≥1,500 usable spaces directly attached or within 3–5 min walk; clear, convenient drop-off within ~50–100 m.
- 7–8 (Good): 600–1,499 spaces within 5–8 min; practical, legal drop-off nearby.
- 5–6 (Adequate): 200–599 spaces or access hampered by congestion/pricing but still workable.
- 3–4 (Poor): Minimal dedicated parking in a car-using context or awkward/unsafe drop-off.
- 0–2 (Very poor): Almost no usable parking or legal drop-off where cars are important.
