# Customer Potential Rubric (Location‑Oriented)

Score **0–10** based on the strength of the catchment and how well it matches the target store type.

### Weights (sum = 100%)

1. Population Density & Catchment Strength – **30%**
2. Demographic & Spending Fit – **30%**
3. Customer Behavior & Demand Potential – **25%**
4. Opportunities & Risks – **15%**

A **9–10** overall Customer score should be reserved for **city/district‑level hubs** that can clearly support above‑average store volumes for the format.

---

## 1. Population Density & Catchment Strength (30%)

Consider both **residential** and **daytime/visitor** populations within **5–10 minutes walk** (≈300–800 m), plus the node’s role (local vs regional).

### Excellent (9–10)

- **Very high accessible population**:
  - As a guideline, within a 10‑minute walk:
    - Residents ≥ **20k**, **or**
    - Average daily daytime + visitor population ≥ **100k**.
- Strong **inbound flows from other districts** (regional shopping/office/transport hub, tourist area, major campus/medical cluster).
- Proven ability to sustain **multiple stores** of similar types (many F&B/retail units with visible traffic).
- Use:
  - **9.0–9.4** for strong **district hubs**.
  - **9.5–10.0** only for **city‑level “super nodes”**: multiple large complexes + major transport interchange + very dense daytime population.

### Good (7–8)

- Solid resident and/or daytime base:
  - Residents ~10k–20k within 10 min, or
  - Daytime + visitors ~30k–100k.
- Acts as a **neighborhood center or secondary CBD**, attracting some inbound traffic.
- Can comfortably support at least one healthy store of the target type.

### Adequate (5–6)

- Moderate catchment:
  - Residents 5k–10k and/or
  - Daytime + visitors 10k–30k.
- Primarily serves **local** demand; some reliance on one or two large institutions (single office park, single school, etc.).

### Poor (3–4)

- Small population within convenient range:
  - Residents <5k and
  - Daytime + visitors <10k.
- Limited anchor institutions; weak role as a local center.

### Insufficient (0–2)

- Very sparse population or highly transient with no clear anchor.
- Catchment unlikely to sustain a store except in a very narrow niche.

---

## 2. Demographic & Spending Fit (30%)

Evaluate age, income, lifestyle, and spending power **relative to the target store type** (e.g., mass‑market convenience vs premium lifestyle).

### Excellent (9–10)

- Target customer groups (by age, income, lifestyle) make up a **clear majority** (≈60%+) of the accessible population.
- **Spending power** at or above city average; strong propensity to spend in the relevant category (e.g., coffee, fashion, beauty).
- Clear alignment with store’s positioning (e.g., young professionals for specialty coffee; families for kids retail).

### Good (7–8)

- Target segments are present and sizeable but mixed with less relevant groups.
- Spending power and lifestyle are generally supportive; some minor mismatches (e.g., more retirees than ideal, but enough workers/students).

### Adequate (5–6)

- Some relevant segments, but no clear dominance.
- Income and lifestyles are mixed; the concept may need adjustment (price tier, product mix) to fit.

### Poor (3–4)

- Target customers are **minority segments**.
- Spending power or lifestyle significantly mismatched with the concept (e.g., premium concept in low‑income area; youth‑oriented offer in mostly elderly area).

### Insufficient (0–2)

- Demographics fundamentally do **not** support the format (e.g., nightlife bar near primarily conservative campus; expensive luxury retail in very low‑income, price‑sensitive community).

---

## 3. Customer Behavior & Demand Potential (25%)

Focus on **recurring demand**, typical **spend patterns**, and **comparable store performance**, not just head counts.

Use **observable evidence**: queues, occupancy, mobile‑data footfall, reported sales of comparable chains, etc.

### Excellent (9–10)

- Multiple **comparable stores or categories** nearby show:
  - Throughput or sales **well above network average** for the format (e.g., top 25% or higher).
- Clear **high‑frequency use cases**:
  - Daily commuters, office workers, students, or residents with repeated needs.
- Temporal pattern strongly supports the model:
  - Several strong peaks (e.g., morning + lunch + afternoon + evening).
- For transaction‑driven formats (F&B, QSR, coffee, basic retail), a realistic target is **well above average** volumes (e.g., ≥1.5× a network‑wide “typical” store) if execution is solid.

### Good (7–8)

- Observed demand around **average to slightly above** for the format.
- One or two strong demand peaks; behavior patterns are fairly predictable.
- New store can reasonably target **network‑average or modestly above** volumes if executed well.

### Adequate (5–6)

- Demand signals exist but are modest or uncertain:
  - Some usage (e.g., lunch only, weekend only), but no clear all‑day flow.
- Comparable stores appear **stable but unremarkable**.

### Poor (3–4)

- Weak or highly volatile demand:
  - Comparable stores often quiet outside a narrow window.
  - Heavy discounting or frequent closures in similar categories.
- Strong reliance on a single, fragile demand driver (e.g., one office tenant, a single school with limited hours).

### Insufficient (0–2)

- No meaningful or consistent demand patterns for the category.
- Comparable attempts frequently **fail or remain empty**.

---

## 4 Opportunities & Risks (15%)

Assess **future potential** and structural risks affecting the customer base.

### Excellent (9–10)

- Clear structural **growth drivers**:
  - New transport hub, large new residential/office projects, upcoming schools/hospitals/universities.
- Demographic trends favorable (younger, wealthier, or more relevant segments increasing).
- No major foreseeable negative shocks (e.g., redevelopment, demolition, relocation of key anchors).

### Good (7–8)

- Some growth opportunities (incremental densification, moderate income growth).
- Risks (e.g., tenant churn, policy changes) appear manageable.

### Adequate (5–6)

- Neutral outlook: limited visible growth, limited decline.

### Poor (3–4)

- Noticeable structural risks:
  - Aging population not aligned with format, shrinking resident base, corporate downsizing, or policy restrictions.
- Only modest or uncertain offsetting opportunities.

### Insufficient (0–2)

- High likelihood that the local customer base will **shrink materially** or become less suitable (e.g., major employer leaving, planned demolition/relocation, strong policy headwinds against the category).
