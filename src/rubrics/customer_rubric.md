# Customer Potential Rubric (Further Revised, Location-Oriented, Commuter-Focused)

Purpose: Score 0–10 based on the strength of the realistically reachable customer base and how well it matches the specific store type and its key earning dayparts.

## Sub-dimension weights for Customer (sum = 100%)

1. Population density and catchment strength – 10%
2. Demographic and spending fit – 10%
3. Customer behavior, daypart and peak demand – 70%
4. Opportunities and risks – 10%

## 1. Population density and catchment strength (10%)

Evaluate both residential and daytime or visitor population within a practical catchment, typically 5–10 minutes' walk (≈300–800 m) in dense urban areas.

### Excellent (9–10)

9.5–10.0 (city-level super-hub)
- Within roughly 10 minutes' walk at least one of:
  - Residents ≥80k plus strong daytime inflow (major offices and at least two large malls or complexes), or
  - Estimated average daytime plus visitor population ≥300k.
- Clear role as a city-scale destination (for example multiple metro or rail lines intersecting, or major transit hub integrated with large commercial or office complexes).

9.0–9.4 (strong district hub)
- Within roughly 10 minutes' walk at least one of:
  - Residents ≈40k–80k, or
  - Daytime plus visitors ≈150k–300k.

### Good (7–8.9)

8.0–8.9 (strong neighborhood or sub-center)
- Residents ≈20k–40k and/or daytime plus visitors ≈80k–150k.

7.0–7.9 (solid local catchment)
- Residents ≈10k–25k and/or daytime plus visitors ≈40k–80k.

### Adequate (5–6.9)
- Residents ≈5k–15k and/or daytime plus visitors ≈20k–40k.

### Poor (3–4.9)
- Residents <5k and daytime plus visitors <20k, or very thin or dispersed population with weak anchors.

### Insufficient (0–2.9)
- Extremely sparse or intermittent population, unlikely to sustain a mainstream cafe or quick-service unit.

---

## 2. Demographic and spending fit (10%)

Evaluate how well age, income, lifestyle, and spending patterns match the format.

### Excellent (9–10)
- Target customer groups by age, income and lifestyle are a clear majority (about 60% or more of reachable population), and
- Strong evidence of current spend in the category (for example multiple healthy comparables, visible queues in relevant dayparts, premium brand mix).

### Good (7–8.9)

- Target segments are large but mixed with less relevant groups.
- Spending power and lifestyle broadly favorable with only minor mismatches.

### Adequate (5–6.9)
- Relevant segments exist but do not dominate, or incomes are mixed; concept may need price or assortment adjustments.

### Poor (3–4.9)
- Target segments are a minority; most locals cannot afford or are not interested in the category.

### Insufficient (0–2.9)
- Demographics are fundamentally misaligned with the format.

---

## 3. Customer behavior, daypart and peak demand (70%)

Assess recurring demand, daypart alignment, and realistic peak reach for the storefront itself, not just for the wider node.

### Excellent (9–10)
- Clear, strong alignment of presence and behavior in the key daypart; dense, repeat office and commuter flows with open access 7:00–10:00 and minimal detour.

### Good (7–8.9)
- Demand patterns in the key window are at or moderately above network average; similar stores perform solidly.

### Adequate (5–6.9)
- Some demand in the key window but modest or partially misaligned with the concept.

### Poor (3–4.9)
- Weak or irregular demand in key dayparts.

### Insufficient (0–2.9)
- No clear demand pattern in the key daypart.

---

## 4. Opportunities and risks (10%)

Consider the likely future direction of the reachable customer base and structural risks affecting it.

### Excellent (9–10)
- Strong visible growth drivers benefiting key segments and dayparts with no major downside risks.

### Good (7–8.9)
- Net positive outlook: some growth or upgrades, manageable risks.

### Adequate (5–6.9)
- Neutral or uncertain; no strong growth or shrinkage expected.

### Poor (3–4.9)
- Noticeable structural risks with limited offsetting upsides.

### Insufficient (0–2.9)
- High likelihood of significant deterioration in customer base or suitability.
