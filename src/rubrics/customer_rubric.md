Customer Potential Rubric

Use this rubric to score locations 0–10 based on the strength of the **realistically reachable** customer base for a coffee shop.

General principles
- Evaluate a **single conservative typical weekday**.
- Use the same fixed **3‑hour morning window** (e.g. 07:30–10:30) for all sites.
- Base all volume estimates on people passing within **~30–40 m of the storefront along natural paths**, not whole‑station or whole‑mall totals.
- Always separate:
  - **repeat, routine users** (commuters, office workers, students, nearby residents using the path ≥ 3 weekdays/week), vs.
  - **irregular leisure / tourist flows** (occasional shoppers, sightseers, cruise guests, park visitors, etc.).
- Prioritise **stable repeat flows** over large but irregular tourist traffic.
- For metro interchanges, only count people who either exit to street near the storefront or walk the specific corridor where the storefront is located; do **not** count pure platform‑to‑platform transfers.
- For each volume‑based sub‑score, first estimate the share of node‑wide flows that actually pass the storefront zone; **apply this share** before placing the site in a band.

Weights (sum = 100%)
1. Weekday repeat commuter and office‑worker base – **32%**
2. Morning‑peak funnel strength (fixed 3‑hour window) – **38%**
3. All‑day non‑commuter / mall / leisure volume – **3%**
4. Storefront exposure and path integration – **18%**
5. Competitive saturation versus effective coffee demand – **4%**
6. Stability and volatility of flows – **3%**
7. Demographic and price‑fit quality – **2%**

Global caps
- If weighted average of sub‑scores (1) + (2) < 6.0, overall score cannot exceed **6.0**, regardless of other dimensions.
- If either sub‑score (1) or (2) < 5.0, overall score cannot exceed **7.0**.
- If < 50% of total reachable flows (by person‑times) are repeat users, overall score cannot exceed **7.0**.

1. Weekday repeat commuter and office‑worker base (32%)

Scope
- Metro and bus commuters who actually pass the storefront corridor.
- Office workers and students with regular weekday routines.
- Nearby residents who **routinely** pass the storefront on workdays.

Key metrics (conservative, typical weekday)
- **Repeat passers**: distinct person‑times per weekday passing within ~30–40 m of the storefront along natural routes.
- **Deterministic repeat cups for this store**: conservative all‑day weekday cups from these repeat users (exclude tourists and purely irregular leisure shoppers).
- Share of node‑wide flows that are true repeat users (≥ 3 weekdays/week).

Score bands (use both volume and cups; if they diverge, place in the lower band)
- **9.0–10.0 (prime repeat base)**
  - Node class: clear city‑prime CBD or major sub‑CBD with large office‑tower cluster.
  - Repeat passers within ~30–40 m: **≥ 45,000 person‑times/weekday**.
  - Deterministic repeat cups for this store: **≥ 900 cups/weekday**.
  - ≥ 70% of reachable flows are repeat users.

- **7.5–8.9 (strong repeat node)**
  - Node class: strong sub‑CBD, concentrated office‑tower area, or high‑intensity station podium.
  - Repeat passers: **18,000–45,000 person‑times/weekday**.
  - Deterministic repeat cups: **350–900 cups/weekday**.
  - ≥ 55% of reachable flows are repeat users.

- **5.0–7.4 (moderate repeat base / community hub)**
  - Node class: community center, district‑level mall, or mixed residential‑commercial area with some offices.
  - Repeat passers: **6,000–18,000 person‑times/weekday**.
  - Deterministic repeat cups: **120–350 cups/weekday**, with at least one strong repeat anchor (office cluster, station, major school).

- **3.0–4.9 (weak repeat base)**
  - Repeat passers: **2,000–6,000 person‑times/weekday**, or
  - Deterministic repeat cups: **60–120 cups/weekday**; flows are thin, fragmented, or require detours.

- **0.0–2.9 (insufficient repeat base)**
  - Repeat passers: **< 2,000 person‑times/weekday**, or
  - Deterministic repeat cups: **< 60 cups/weekday**.

Adjustments
- If 50–60% of reachable flows are repeat users, cap this sub‑score at **8.0** even if raw volumes fit a higher band.
- If < 50% of reachable flows are repeat users, cap this sub‑score at **7.0**.
- Locations where the majority of repeat passers are **office workers in Grade A/B towers** can be placed **toward the top** of their band; those dominated by low‑frequency community errands should be placed **toward the bottom**.

---
2. Morning‑peak funnel strength (fixed 3‑hour window) (38%)

Scope
- Concentration and volume of **repeat users** in a fixed 3‑hour morning window (e.g. 07:30–10:30).
- Passers within ~30–40 m of the storefront, on **natural commuter paths**.

Key metrics (conservative)
- **Morning repeat passers**: person‑times in the 3‑hour window.
- **Deterministic morning cups for this store**: conservative cups sold in that window to repeat users.
- Physical integration with main commuter flows (multi‑line intersections, bus hubs, building lobbies above stations).

Score bands (prioritise cups; use passers as a cross‑check)
- **9.0–10.0 (prime commuter funnel)**
  - Morning repeat passers within ~30–40 m: **≥ 12,000 person‑times (3 hours)**, and
  - Deterministic morning cups: **≥ 600 cups (3 hours)**.
  - Storefront **directly on, or immediately adjacent (≤ 20–30 m)** to a core commuter path; detour ≤ 30 seconds; no extra security or level changes.

- **7.5–8.9 (strong commuter peak)**
  - Morning repeat passers: **6,000–12,000 person‑times (3 hours)**, and/or
  - Deterministic morning cups: **300–600 cups (3 hours)**.
  - Storefront adjacent (≤ 1 minute detour) to busy station exits, tower lobbies, or main street commuter corridors, with clear sightlines.

- **5.0–7.4 (moderate morning peak)**
  - Morning repeat passers: **2,000–6,000 person‑times (3 hours)**, or
  - Deterministic morning cups: **100–300 cups (3 hours)**.
  - Flows present but less compressed, partly off‑path, or tied mainly to a district‑level node.

- **3.0–4.9 (limited morning peak)**
  - Morning repeat passers: **700–2,000 person‑times (3 hours)**, or
  - Deterministic morning cups: **30–100 cups (3 hours)**; commuters are scattered or must detour noticeably.

- **0.0–2.9 (no meaningful morning peak)**
  - Morning repeat passers: **< 700 person‑times (3 hours)**, or
  - Deterministic morning cups: **< 30 cups (3 hours)**.

Adjustments
- If morning flows in the corridor are dominated by **irregular tourists or one‑off leisure visitors**, reduce this sub‑score by **1.0–1.5** within the band.
- Do **not** assign a prime commuter band score based solely on whole‑station totals; first estimate what share of station flows uses the specific exit and path in front of the storefront.
- When two locations have similar passers but one has a **much higher proportion of office‑tower commuters**, place that site **higher within the same band**.

---
3. All‑day non‑commuter / mall / leisure volume (3%)

Scope
- Shoppers, tourists, hotel guests, park users, and other **irregular** visitors.
- Focus on incremental value beyond the repeat commuter/office base.

Key metrics (conservative)
- **Reachable leisure passers**: person‑times per weekday within ~30–40 m linked to malls, attractions, hotels, or leisure streets (excluding the repeat users already counted).
- **Conservative incremental cups** from these users (all‑day weekday), excluding repeat commuters.

Score bands
- **9.0–10.0 (very strong leisure base)**
  - Reachable leisure passers: **≥ 60,000 person‑times/weekday**.
  - Incremental deterministic cups from leisure users: **≥ 250 cups/weekday**.

- **7.5–8.9 (strong leisure base)**
  - Reachable leisure passers: **25,000–60,000 person‑times/weekday**.
  - Incremental deterministic cups: **100–250 cups/weekday**.

- **5.0–7.4 (moderate leisure base)**
  - Reachable leisure passers: **8,000–25,000 person‑times/weekday**, or
  - Incremental deterministic cups: **30–100 cups/weekday**.

- **3.0–4.9 (weak leisure base)**
  - Reachable leisure passers: **3,000–8,000 person‑times/weekday**, or
  - Incremental deterministic cups: **10–30 cups/weekday**.

- **0.0–2.9 (minimal leisure base)**
  - Reachable leisure passers: **< 3,000 person‑times/weekday**, or
  - Incremental deterministic cups: **< 10 cups/weekday**.

Notes
- Do not let this sub‑score compensate for a weak repeat commuter and office base (see global caps).
- In tourist‑heavy corridors, be conservative with conversion rates and do not assume repeat behaviour.

4. Storefront exposure and path integration (18%)

Scope
- How much of the node's relevant traffic **naturally passes the door**.
- Micro‑placement within malls, podiums, and street grids.

Key measures
- Share of relevant flows (repeat + leisure) that pass within ~20–30 m of the storefront with clear sightlines.
- Need for level changes, security checks, or long detours.

Score bands
- **9.0–10.0 (highly exposed)**
  - Storefront on a **main pedestrian conduit** (core mall spine, building lobby throat, main station corridor, or unavoidable street path).
  - **≥ 50%** of relevant repeat flows pass within ~30 m with clear visibility.
  - Detour from primary commuter path **≤ 1 minute**; no extra security checks or complex vertical circulation.

- **7.5–8.9 (good exposure)**
  - Near main flows; **25–50%** of relevant repeat flows pass within ~30 m, or
  - Detour ≤ 2 minutes with clear visibility and one simple level change (direct escalator/elevator).

- **5.0–7.4 (moderate exposure)**
  - On a secondary corridor; **10–25%** of relevant repeat flows pass naturally, or
  - Detour 2–4 minutes and/or one significant level change or security barrier.

- **3.0–4.9 (low exposure)**
  - Hidden on upper/basement/back corridors; **< 10%** of relevant flows pass by; detour > 4 minutes or multiple level changes.

- **0.0–2.9 (very poor exposure)**
  - Isolated or back‑of‑house; almost all visitors must come intentionally; negligible spontaneous pass‑by.

Note
- When estimating repeat volumes in sub‑scores (1) and (2), you must **explicitly apply** the exposure share from this sub‑score to node‑level flows before assigning bands.

---
5. Competitive saturation versus effective coffee demand (4%)

Scope
- Balance between deterministic node coffee demand and direct competition.

Definitions
- **Direct competitors**: branded or specialty coffee outlets and convenience formats selling espresso‑based drinks within ~100–150 m along the same main paths.
- **Deterministic node coffee demand**: conservative estimate of total weekday coffee cups that all operators combined can sustainably sell from reachable flows (based on observed or modelled conversion rates).

Key metrics
- Approximate **cups/day per coffee store on the main flows**.

Score bands
- **9.0–10.0 (high demand, manageable competition)**
  - Deterministic node coffee demand: **≥ 3,000 cups/weekday**.
  - ≤ 5 strong direct competitors sharing the same main flows.
  - A new store can plausibly reach **≥ 15% market share** without severe price pressure.

- **7.5–8.9 (balanced)**
  - Deterministic node coffee demand: **1,500–3,000 cups/weekday**.
  - 4–9 direct competitors; sustainable volume per operator remains healthy.

- **5.0–7.4 (tight)**
  - Deterministic node coffee demand: **700–1,500 cups/weekday**, or
  - ≥ 8 direct competitors on the same main paths; a new entrant likely captures only modest share unless strongly differentiated.

- **3.0–4.9 (over‑supplied)**
  - Deterministic node coffee demand: **< 700 cups/weekday** with many established competitors, or
  - Clear evidence of weak performance or closures among similar coffee outlets on the same flows.

- **0.0–2.9 (unsustainable)**
  - Very low demand and high competition; a new store is unlikely to reach viable volumes even with strong execution.

Adjustments
- In tourist‑heavy corridors with dense coffee clustering, reduce this sub‑score by **0.5–1.0** within the band unless there is clear unmet morning‑peak demand from repeat commuters.

---
6. Stability and volatility of flows (3%)

Scope
- Long‑term predictability of reachable demand in the specific corridors feeding the storefront.

Consider
- Maturity and trajectory of the commercial node.
- Dependence on single anchors (one mall, one office tower, one tourist attraction).
- Visible signs of growth or decline along the actual paths that feed the store.

Score bands
- **9.0–10.0 (very stable with upside)**
  - Mature or rising CBD/sub‑CBD with strong long‑term anchors (large offices, major transit, established malls) on the same paths as the storefront.
  - No visible major risks that would significantly reduce corridor footfall.

- **7.5–8.9 (stable)**
  - Generally stable with some upside from new projects or improvements; limited short‑term disruptions; anchors diversified.

- **5.0–7.4 (neutral or uncertain)**
  - Anchors present but mixed signals: aging mall, visible vacancies, repositioning works, or partial reliance on cyclical tourist or event flows.

- **3.0–4.9 (negative bias)**
  - Evidence of declining performance (shrinking tenant mix, repeated closures, or office/transit shifting away).

- **0.0–2.9 (high deterioration risk)**
  - High likelihood of structural decline in reachable demand due to major anchor exits, transit re‑routing, or sustained adverse policy impacts.

---
7. Demographic and price‑fit quality (2%)

Scope
- Match between reachable repeat users and typical boutique/specialty coffee customers in age, income, and habits.

Consider
- Share of reachable repeat base that is working‑age white‑collar, students, or younger professionals.
- Surrounding tenant mix and price positioning of nearby F&B and retail as a proxy for disposable income and coffee habit.

Score bands
- **9.0–10.0 (excellent fit)**
  - **≥ 60%** of reachable repeat users are target segments with clear discretionary spending (office workers, young professionals, students).
  - Surrounding tenant mix skewed to mid/high‑end brands and visible existing coffee culture (multiple specialty or international chains with stable presence).

- **7.5–8.9 (good fit)**
  - **40–60%** of reachable repeat users fit the target profile; income levels supportive; some visible coffee habit.

- **5.0–7.4 (mixed fit)**
  - **25–40%** fit the target; a large share of nearby population is elderly, lower‑income, or infrequent coffee drinkers; some adaptation of product/price may be needed.

- **3.0–4.9 (weak fit)**
  - **10–25%** fit the target; most locals are unlikely to buy specialty coffee frequently; better suited to value formats.

- **0.0–2.9 (poor fit)**
  - **< 10%** of reachable repeat users fit the specialty coffee target; format largely misaligned with local demand.
