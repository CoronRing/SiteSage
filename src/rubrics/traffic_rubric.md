# Traffic and Accessibility Rubric

Purpose: Score 0–10 based on how easily and naturally target customers reach and pass the storefront, and the magnitude and timing of those flows. Emphasis is on storefront-level access and pass-by, not just node-wide transit volumes.

## Sub-dimension weights for Traffic (sum = 100%)

1. Public transit and connectivity quality – 20%
2. Walkability, parking and road access – 10%
3. Target customer mobility fit – 10%
4. Traffic volume and temporal benefits – 60%

## 1. Public transit and connectivity quality (20%)

Evaluate potential inflow to the immediate area from metro or rail and major buses, before micro-routing inside buildings.

Consider:
- Number of lines and modes.
- Distance from key exits or hubs to the overall project or building.
- Daily passenger throughput.

### Excellent (8–10)

### 9.0-10.0 (top-tier city transit hubs, directly integrated)
- Three or more metro or rail lines, or metro plus a major intercity or bus hub.
- At least one major entrance or concourse is inside the project or within roughly 0–50 m, with high-capacity, sheltered paths.
- In a large city, daily passenger throughput ≈250k–300k or more.

### 8.0–9.0 (strong multi-line or regional nodes)
- Two or more high-frequency metro lines, or one metro line plus a dense bus hub, with main exits within about 0–300 m.
- In a large city, daily passenger throughput ≈120k–250k.

### Good (6.5–8.0)
- Solid transit: one major metro line or bus rapid transit within roughly 300–500 m plus multiple bus routes, or smaller multi-line nodes with ≈20k–120k daily passengers.

### Adequate (5–6.5)
- Basic coverage: one line or a few routes within roughly 500–800 m and ≈5k–20k daily passengers.

### Poor (3–4.9)
- Sparse or inconvenient transit for target users.

### Insufficient (0–2.9)
- Minimal transit access.

## 2. Walkability, parking and road access (10%)

Assess pedestrian quality, vehicle access, and approach simplicity.

### Excellent (9–10)
- Safe, continuous sidewalks; natural desire lines pass directly by the storefront.
- Multiple barrier-free entries; good shelter from rain, heat and cold for main flows.
- Sufficient parking within roughly 3–5 minutes' walk and simple car access if drivers are a meaningful segment.

### Good (7–8.9)
- Generally good walking conditions with minor flaws; adequate parking within about 5–8 minutes or workable short-stop options.

### Adequate (5–6.9)
- Mixed: some indirect or fragmented walkways, awkward but usable parking, or minor safety concerns.

### Poor (3–4.9)
- Difficult walking (dangerous crossings, missing sidewalks) or very limited parking in a car-dependent context.

### Insufficient (0–2.9)
- Major physical or regulatory barriers severely limit reachability.

## 3. Target customer mobility fit (10%)

How well actual access modes and micro-routes match how target customers travel between transit, parking, offices, homes, and the store.

### Excellent (9–10)
- Dominant travel modes are directly and conveniently served:
  - For metro office commuters: key exits and walking routes run past or beside the storefront within roughly 150 m, preferably on the shortest paths between station and office clusters.
  - For car users where relevant: parking in the same project or adjacent, with simple vertical circulation to the store level.
- For most target users, extra detour versus their natural path is ≤3 minutes, often ≈0–2 minutes.
- Main flows in critical hours coincide with open, accessible entries and corridors.

### Commuter caps (hard):
- For commuter-dependent formats, if more than half of relevant commuters must detour >4 minutes off their station-to-office or home-to-station routes, cap this sub-score at 7.5.
- If more than half must detour >6 minutes, cap at 6.5.

### Good (7–8.9)
- Mostly aligned; typical detours ≈3–5 minutes for major segments, with straightforward routing and limited friction.

### Adequate (5–6.9)
- Partial alignment: some key segments are well served; others require 5–10 minute detours, awkward transfers, or unclear routing.

### Poor (3–4.9)
- Major target segments face significant friction.

### Insufficient (0–2.9)
- Access patterns are clearly misaligned with how likely customers travel.

## 4. Traffic volume and temporal benefits (60%)

Evaluate how much usable traffic actually passes near the storefront (roughly 0–30 m) and whether it aligns with key dayparts.

### Excellent (9–10)
- Storefront lies directly on a primary pedestrian flow (station exit concourse, main mall spine between major anchors, or primary high-street corner) with strong volumes in relevant hours.

### Good (7–8.9)
- Storefront is close to but not perfectly on a main corridor, or traffic is strong but concentrated in fewer windows.

### Adequate (5–6.9)
- Moderate pass-by: side corridors, secondary streets, or upper floors with some draw.

### Poor (3–4.9)
- Limited passing traffic, such as rear streets or deep interior corners.

### Insufficient (0–2.9)
- Very low visible traffic near the site, heavily destination-only.
