**REVISED RUBRIC**

# Customer Potential Rubric (Location‑Oriented)

Score **0–10** based on the strength of the **effective customer base** and how well it matches the target store type.

### Weights (sum = 100%)

1. Population Density & Catchment Strength – **30%**  
2. Demographic & Spending Fit – **30%**  
3. Customer Behavior & Demand Potential – **25%**  
4. Opportunities & Risks – **15%**

---

## Core Definitions (for all sub‑dimensions)

- **Effective customer base** = people who are realistically addressable as **frequent or recurring users** (e.g., workers, nearby residents, students, staff, regular visitors) and can reach the site within about **5–10 minutes** by their normal mode.

- For **high‑frequency formats** (daily / weekly use such as coffee, QSR, convenience, basic services):  
  - **Repeat users near their daily anchor points (work/study)** should be **weighted more heavily** than infrequent visitors.  
  - As a rough guide, within the same city and price tier, **1 office worker with 5‑day presence near the site ≈ 1.5–2.0 “generic” residents** in terms of potential weekly transactions for work‑day–anchored formats (e.g., weekday coffee, lunch).  
  - For **home‑anchored formats** (e.g., local supermarkets, some family services), nearby residents may be more valuable than transient workers.

- **Typical store volume** = average sustainable performance of existing stores (or peers) for the same format and city tier.

---

## Hard Relative Calibration Rules (multi‑site, same concept & city)

Use these when you have **portfolio or benchmark sales data** for comparable stores:

- If Location A’s **sustainable volumes** are **≈1.2–1.5×** Location B’s for the same concept and dayparts:  
  - **Customer Potential(A)** should normally be **≈0.4–0.7 points higher** than **Customer Potential(B)**.

- If A is **≈1.5–2.0×** B:  
  - **Customer Potential(A)** should normally be **≈0.8–1.2 points higher**.

- If A is **≈2.0–2.5×** B:  
  - **Customer Potential(A)** should normally be **≈1.2–1.8 points higher**.

- If A is **≥2.5–3.0×** B:  
  - **Customer Potential(A)** should normally be **≈1.8–2.2 points higher**, and they **must not** both sit in the same narrow high band (e.g., both ≥8.8).

- If A is **≥3×** B:  
  - **Customer Potential(A)** should normally be **≈2.0–2.5 points higher**, and B should typically drop at least one qualitative band (e.g., from “Excellent” to “Good/Adequate”).

- When portfolio data show that a **smaller or less “famous” node** delivers **higher realized volumes** than a nominally “bigger” node, down‑adjust the bigger node’s **Customer Behavior & Demand** score to reflect **practical capture limits** (competition, micro‑location, daypart mismatch), not just raw footfall.

---

## City‑Level Anchoring & Node‑Tier Caps

- Within a city, identify **1–3 benchmark “super nodes”** for each major format/daypart (e.g., top central CBD, main interchange). These can score **≈9.3–10.0** on Customer Potential if clearly suitable.

- **Strong but clearly smaller district hubs** should generally be capped for Customer Potential at:  
  - **≈8.5–8.7** if their typical per‑store volumes are **~70–85%** of super nodes.  
  - **≈7.5–8.0** if typical volumes are **~40–60%** of super nodes, even when raw populations look large (e.g., outer transport + residential interchanges).

- **Interior or peripheral units within super nodes** (e.g., inside one of many malls, or serving only a subset of the node’s flows) should usually be anchored **one band lower** than the node’s theoretical maximum for the format (e.g., **≈8.5–9.0**, not 9.7–10.0).

---

## 1. Population Density & Catchment Strength (30%)

Consider **residential** and **daytime/visitor** populations within **5–10 minutes** (≈300–800 m), and the node’s role.

### Excellent (9–10)

- Very high accessible population **relevant to the format**:  
  - Within ~10 minutes:
    - Residents ≥ **20k**, **or**  
    - Daily daytime + visitor population ≥ **100k**, with a meaningful portion in the target segments.

- Strong **inbound flows from other districts** (regional shopping/office/transport hub, major tourist/campus/medical/administrative center).

- Proven ability to support **multiple healthy stores** of similar types.

Use sub‑bands:

- **9.0–9.2 – Strong district hub**  
  - Single major transit or CBD node; daytime + visitors typically **~100k–150k/day** relevant to the format.

- **9.3–9.4 – Large district / emerging city hub**  
  - Several sizable office/retail/institutional anchors; daytime + visitors **~150k–220k/day** for relevant users.

- **9.5–10.0 – City‑level “super node” (rare)**  
  - Multi‑line interchange and/or core CBD with **>220k–250k/day** relevant flows.  
  - One of the city’s top few nodes for **effective** footfall in that format/daypart.

### Good (7–8)

- Solid resident/daytime base:  
  - Residents ~**10k–20k** within 10 minutes, or  
  - Daytime + visitors ~**30k–100k**.

- Functions as a **neighborhood center or secondary CBD**.

### Adequate (5–6)

- Moderate catchment:  
  - Residents **5k–10k**, and/or  
  - Daytime + visitors **10k–30k**.

- Primarily local demand with one or two key anchors.

### Poor (3–4)

- Small population within convenient range:  
  - Residents <**5k** and daytime + visitors <**10k**.  
- Weak local center role.

### Insufficient (0–2)

- Very sparse population or transient flows without a clear anchor.

---

## 2. Demographic & Spending Fit (30%)

Assess age, income, occupation, lifestyle, and spending power **vs. the target format**.

### Excellent (9–10)

- Target customer groups (by age/income/lifestyle) ≈**60%+** of effective base.

- Spending power **at or above city average**, with strong propensity to spend in the category.

- Clear alignment with concept positioning (e.g., white‑collar CBD for premium / boutique coffee; young families for kids’ retail).

### Good (7–8)

- Target segments are sizeable but mixed with less relevant groups.

- Spending power broadly supportive; small mismatches (e.g., more retirees but still many workers/students).

### Adequate (5–6)

- Relevant segments present but not dominant. Mixed income and needs.

### Poor (3–4)

- Target customers are minority segments; incomes or lifestyle poorly matched to the concept.

### Insufficient (0–2)

- Demographics fundamentally do not support the format.

---

## 3. Customer Behavior & Demand Potential (25%)

Focus on **recurring demand patterns** and **comparable store performance**, not just head counts.

Use evidence: queueing, occupancy, mobile‑data footfall, reported sales, delivery order density, etc.

### Excellent (9–10)

- Multiple comparable stores nearby show **sustained, clearly above‑average performance** (e.g., top quartile or better in the network).

- Strong **high‑frequency use cases** aligned with the concept (e.g., large office worker base for weekday coffee/lunch; dense student base for value F&B; heavy family visits for kids’ services).

- Temporal pattern strongly supports the model (several strong peaks, or a very strong single critical peak for single‑daypart formats).

- Realistic potential to reach **≥1.5× “typical” store volumes** if well executed.

> **Relative calibration within this sub‑dimension:**  
> - If Node A’s comparable store volumes are **1.2–1.5×** Node B’s, **Demand(A)** should normally be **≈0.4–0.7** points higher.  
> - If **1.5–2.0×**, use **≈0.8–1.2** points higher.  
> - If **2.0–2.5×**, use **≈1.2–1.8** points higher.  
> - If **≥2.5–3.0×**, use **≈1.8–2.2** points higher, and avoid placing both nodes in the same narrow high band (e.g., both ≥8.5).  
> - If **≥3×**, use **≈2.0–2.5** points higher.

> **Saturation feedback rule:**  
> - In dense CBDs or category clusters where **many comparable units perform only average or slightly above average**, do **not** assign Demand scores in the very top band (≥9.0) solely because the node is large. Typical scores will be in **7.0–8.5** unless there is clear evidence of top‑quartile per‑store performance.

### Good (7–8)

- Observed demand around **average to slightly above** for the format.

- Predictable peaks in relevant windows; new store can reasonably target **network‑average or modestly above**.

### Adequate (5–6)

- Some demand but modest or uncertain; comparable stores appear stable but unremarkable.

### Poor (3–4)

- Weak or volatile demand; frequent discounting or closures; reliance on a fragile driver.

### Insufficient (0–2)

- No consistent demand pattern for the category; repeated failures.

---

## 4. Opportunities & Risks (15%)

Assess how the **effective customer base** may evolve.

### Excellent (9–10)

- Clear structural **growth drivers**: large upcoming office/residential projects, new transport, major institutional developments.

- Trends in demographics or land use increase alignment with the format; no major downside risks identified.

### Good (7–8)

- Some credible growth opportunities; risks appear manageable.

### Adequate (5–6)

- Neutral outlook: limited visible growth or decline.

### Poor (3–4)

- Notable structural risks (aging population, corporate exits, policy constraints) with limited offsetting upside.

### Insufficient (0–2)

- High likelihood that the effective base will **shrink materially** or become less suitable.

## Customer Potential – Recommended Output Format

```json
{
  "score": 8.2,
  "justification": "Dense daytime and visitor population, strong presence of target customer groups, and observable recurring demand for similar formats support above-average customer potential. Demographics and spending power align well with the concept’s price tier and usage frequency, with a generally stable to positive outlook and no major structural downside risks."
}
```

---

# Traffic & Accessibility Potential Rubric (Location‑Oriented)

Score **0–10** based on how easily and **naturally** target customers can reach and pass the **actual site** on their normal paths, especially in **critical dayparts** for the format.

### Weights (sum = 100%)

1. Public Transit & Connectivity Quality – **35%**  
2. Walkability, Parking & Road Access – **25%**  
3. Target Customer Mobility Fit – **20%**  
4. Traffic Volume & Temporal Benefits – **20%**

---

## Cross‑Site Relative Calibration (same concept & city)

- If Location A’s **effective flows past the storefront in critical dayparts** are **≈1.2–1.5×** B’s, and micro‑locations are comparable, then **Traffic(A)** should usually be **≈0.5–0.7 points higher** than **Traffic(B)**.

- If A’s effective flows are **≈1.5–2.0×** B’s:  
  - Difference should normally be **≈0.8–1.2 points**.

- If **≈2.0–2.5×**:  
  - Difference should normally be **≈1.2–1.8 points**.

- If **≥2.5–3.0×**:  
  - Difference should normally be **≈1.8–2.2 points**, and they should **not both** be scored in the same narrow high band (e.g., both ≥9.0).

- For two sites in the **same node/complex** where one is on the **primary desire line** and the other requires a **3–5+ minute extra detour** for key users, their overall Traffic & Accessibility scores should generally differ by **≥1.0–1.5 points**.

---

## Daypart Alignment Rule (format‑sensitive)

- For formats heavily dependent on a **specific daypart** (e.g., weekday mornings for commuter coffee/QSR, evenings for bars, weekend afternoons for family leisure), base Traffic scoring on **effective flows and friction during that window**, not just full‑day averages.

- If a site’s **corridors/entrances are closed or constrained** during the critical daypart (e.g., interior mall routes closed before 10:00), then:
  - **Public Transit** and/or **Mobility Fit** subscores should be **capped in the Adequate band (≤6.9)** for that format, regardless of how strong the node is at other times.

---

## Interior‑Unit Adjustment Rule

- For **interior mall/podium units** attached to major hubs:
  - If customers must navigate **secondary corridors, multiple turns, level changes, or restricted opening hours**, treat effective connectivity as **one band lower** than the raw node:
    - E.g., cap overall Traffic & Accessibility at **≈9.0** even if the station merits 9.5–10.0.
  - If walking distance from the primary transit exit to the unit is **>500–600 m (≈8–10 minutes)** for critical flows, then:
    - Cap **Public Transit & Connectivity** typically at **≤8.0**, and
    - Reflect additional friction under **Target Customer Mobility Fit** and **Traffic Volume & Temporal Benefits**.

---

## 1. Public Transit & Connectivity Quality (35%)

Consider **modes, distance, integration, volumes**, and how much of that **realistically feeds the site**.

### Excellent (9–10)

- Node is among **top ~10–15%** in the city for relevant passenger volumes.

- Multiple high‑frequency modes (e.g., **2+ metro lines**, or metro + dense bus hub/BRT).

- Distance from **main transit exits** to the project entrance:  
  - Typically **≤300 m (≤5 minutes)** for most target users;  
  - For 9.5–10.0, the project is **inside or directly on top of** the station/hub with very short, intuitive connections.

- For **interior units**, these bands apply only if the **internal path to the unit** is short and obvious (e.g., ≤150–200 m from main mall entrance with minimal turns).

### Good (7–8.5)

- Strong transit but not top‑decile:  
  - At least one major rail line or strong bus/BRT network.  
  - Typical walk distances **≤500 m** from main stops/stations to project.

- Passenger volumes clearly above city average.

- For interior units with **400–600 m** station distance and some corridor navigation, transit may still be **Good**, but rarely above **≈8.0–8.3**.

### Adequate (5–6.9)

- Basic coverage: one line or a few bus routes within **500–800 m**.

- Gaps in service hours/frequency or indirect paths for many target users.

### Poor (3–4.9)

- Sparse or inconvenient transit; no rail within easy walking distance or infrequent buses.

### Insufficient (0–2.9)

- Minimal or no effective transit access for most target customers.

---

## 2. Walkability, Parking & Road Access (25%)

Evaluate the **on‑foot experience** and **vehicle access**.

### Excellent (9–10)

- Safe, continuous sidewalks and **natural pedestrian paths** that **directly pass the storefront** (street) or its immediate corridor (mall).

- Multiple, barrier‑free entry points.

- Adequate, reasonably priced parking **≤3–5 minutes** away, or strong drop‑off arrangements.

- Simple, well‑signed roads; congestion manageable in key trading periods.

### Good (7–8)

- Generally walkable, minor issues (some crossings/narrow sidewalks, occasional obstructions).

- Usable parking within **5–8 minutes** or effective drop‑off zones.

### Adequate (5–6)

- Mixed: indirect or fragmented walkways, less convenient parking, or more complex navigation.

### Poor (3–4)

- Material issues for pedestrians (unsafe crossings, missing sidewalks) **or** difficult/expensive parking and confusing vehicle access.

### Insufficient (0–2)

- Physical or regulatory barriers severely limit reachability (e.g., gated campus, no sidewalks).

---

## 3. Target Customer Mobility Fit (20%)

How well the site’s access aligns with **how the target segments actually travel and move**.

### Excellent (9–10)

- Dominant travel modes of key customers are **directly supported**:  
  - E.g., office towers directly connected to a podium mall; student campus at next door station; drivers with plentiful nearby parking.

- Extra detour vs. natural path for most key users is **≤3 minutes**.

- For interior units, **early‑morning/late‑evening paths** used by key segments are clearly open and simple, if those dayparts matter.

### Good (7–8)

- Mostly aligned with some friction; typical detour **≤5 minutes** for main segments.

- Internal routes are reasonably direct but may not be on the absolute main desire line.

### Adequate (5–6)

- Partial alignment; some important segments face moderate detours or extra vertical circulation.

### Poor (3–4)

- Main customer segments face material frictions:  
  - Long detours, closed corridors at key times, or no parking despite car dependence.

- For morning‑critical formats, if early‑hour access routes (e.g., mall interiors) are uncertain or open late, Mobility Fit should rarely exceed **6.0–6.5**.

### Insufficient (0–2)

- Mobility is structurally mismatched with target segments; regular use is unrealistic.

---

## 4. Traffic Volume & Temporal Benefits (20%)

Assess **actual flows near the storefront** and their timing.

### Excellent (9–10)

- Storefront or immediate corridor lies on a **primary pedestrian desire line**: main station‑to‑office route, principal street frontage, main mall axis.

- Strong, predictable flows in **critical dayparts** for the format (e.g., sustained commuter streams in 7:30–9:30 for weekday coffee).

- Realistic potential for **above‑average pass‑by volumes** vs. network norms.

> **Micro‑location rule (within same node):**  
> - If Site A is on the main desire line and Site B requires a **3–5+ minute detour** or lies on a clearly secondary corridor, **Traffic Volume** for A should be **≥1.0 point higher** than B’s, and this difference should also be visible in overall Traffic & Accessibility.

### Good (7–8)

- Solid flows; storefront is near but not exactly on the main stream, or flows are very strong only in some periods while acceptable in others.

### Adequate (5–6)

- Moderate flows; site may be slightly off main corridors and partially dependent on destination traffic or wayfinding.

### Poor (3–4)

- Limited passive traffic; side street, upper floor with weak draw, or deep interior unit without strong anchors/wayfinding.

### Insufficient (0–2)

- Very low visible traffic; almost entirely destination‑driven.

---

## Traffic & Accessibility – Recommended Output Format

```json
{
  "score": 8.9,
  "justification": "The site is closely integrated with strong transit and road access and lies on or near primary pedestrian desire lines during critical dayparts. Walking distances and detours are low for key segments, walkability is high, and parking/drop-off are workable, supporting above-average effective pass-by volumes."
}
```

# Competition & Positioning Rubric (Location‑Oriented)

Score **0–10** based on **net competitive favorability**: density and proximity of substitutes, saturation vs demand, white‑space opportunities, and competitive risk.

### Weights (sum = 100%)

1. Competitor Density & Proximity – **30%**  
2. Market Saturation vs. Demand – **25%**  
3. Positioning Opportunity – **30%**  
4. Competitive Risk – **15%**

The goal is to distinguish **demand‑rich but crowded hubs** from **truly over‑supplied or high‑risk micro‑markets**.

---

## Cross‑Site Relative Calibration

- If two locations have **similar Customer and Traffic scores**, but Location A has **≈1.5–2×** as many **direct substitutes** within the same effective catchment as B, then:  
  - **Competition(A)** should normally be **≈0.5–1.0 points lower** than **Competition(B)**, unless demand and white‑space are clearly stronger.

- If A has **≥2–3×** as many direct substitutes as B, with broadly similar demand context:  
  - **Competition(A)** should normally be **≈1.0–1.5 points lower**.

- Between two high‑demand hubs, the **more crowded node should rarely receive a better (higher) Competition score** than the less crowded one; at best it should be similar if differentiation opportunities and incumbent performance are clearly stronger.

---

## Hyper‑Cluster Rule (“Food Court / Coffee Cluster” Corridors)

- In micro‑markets where, within **~200–300 m**, there are roughly **≥10–12 direct substitutes** in the **same broad category and price tier** (e.g., many chain and indie coffee/QSR/bakery brands on the same mall level or corridor):

  - Treat this as a **category cluster**, not normal scattered competition.

  - For a new, non‑unique entrant:
    - **Competitor Density & Proximity** should typically fall within **≈4.0–5.5**.  
    - Overall Competition scores should usually be **≤6.5** unless there is clear, chain‑specific evidence that most incumbents in that cluster run at **well above network‑average volumes**.

  - Do **not** give “Good” (≥7.0) Competition scores in such clusters **unless** the concept has a clearly differentiated role (e.g., unique price tier/format/daypart) and the cluster is demonstrably under‑supplied relative to high demand.

---

## 1. Competitor Density & Proximity (30%)

Count **direct substitutes** within ~300–800 m and their clustering around the site.

### Excellent (9–10)

- Light, balanced competition:
  - A few competitors that validate demand but leave **clear spatial or conceptual gaps**.

- No major direct competitor in **immediate adjacency** (e.g., same corridor/entrance) unless the new concept is clearly complementary or differentiated.

### Good (7–8)

- Manageable number of competitors:
  - Several operators in walking range, but **not tightly clustered** at the same micro‑location.

- Mix of complementary and partially overlapping offers; some direct substitutes but dispersed.

### Adequate (5–6)

- Noticeable density of direct substitutes, including several within **100–300 m**.

- Differentiation by price/format/experience/daypart is **possible**, and/or demand is clearly strong enough to support multiple players.

- **Demand‑rich red corridors** in major hubs (many busy competitors, no clear oversupply) often sit here.

> **Hard rule for large hubs:**  
> - In locations with **strong Customer (≥8.5) and Traffic (≥8.5)**, do **not** score this sub‑dimension below **5.0** purely on competitor counts **unless** there is concrete evidence of many weak/empty stores or frequent closures.

- Within this 5–6 band, nodes with **significantly more direct substitutes** (e.g., ≥2–3×) vs another similar hub should be placed towards the **lower end** (e.g., 5.0–5.3 vs 5.7–6.0).

### Poor (3–4)

- High density of direct competitors **tightly clustered** around the site:
  - Many near‑identical offers in the same price tier and format within a 2–3 minute walk.

- Competitors already occupy the best micro‑locations; limited remaining exposure.

- Use when density is high **and** demand appears only moderate, or visible signs of emerging stress appear among incumbents.

### Insufficient (0–2)

- **Extreme clustering** of direct substitutes with clear evidence that new entrants routinely underperform (chronically empty stores, frequent closures).

---

## 2. Market Saturation vs. Demand (25%)

Match **aggregate category supply** to **aggregate effective demand**.

### Excellent (9–10)

- Clear **unmet demand**:
  - Persistent queues, long waits, capacity constraints; incumbents visibly stretched.

- Few signs of over‑supply; rents and occupancies strong.

### Good (7–8)

- Demand likely supports additional entrants:
  - Most incumbents are busy or at least healthy.  
  - No systematic deep discounting or high failure rates.

- New store can grow mainly via **incremental demand** plus moderate share capture.

### Adequate (5–6)

- Rough balance between supply and demand:
  - Some operators busy, others average or weak.  
  - Additional entry requires **share capture** and/or a clear niche, but is not obviously impossible.

> **High‑demand hub rule:**  
> - In large CBDs or transport hubs with many generally healthy category players and few closures, dense competition alone should lead to **≈5–6** here, not **3–4**, unless there are visible oversupply signals (e.g., empty units, persistent heavy discounting).

### Poor (3–4)

- Signs of emerging or actual over‑supply:
  - Several under‑utilized units; aggressive price wars common; weak off‑peak traffic even in good sites.

- New entrants will mainly need to **win share from incumbents**; incremental demand is limited.

### Insufficient (0–2)

- Market appears **fully saturated or shrinking**:
  - Many chronically weak units, high churn, declining customer base.

- New entry is structurally high risk.

---

## 3. Positioning Opportunity (30%)

Assess **room to differentiate** meaningfully on price, quality, speed, assortment, experience, daypart, or segment.

### Excellent (9–10)

- Clear, sizable **white spaces**:
  - Missing price tiers (no credible premium or value option).  
  - Missing formats (e.g., no express/fast model vs all sit‑down; no family‑friendly vs all adult‑oriented).  
  - Untapped dayparts (e.g., early morning, late night) or segments (e.g., health‑focused, blue‑collar workforce, kids).

- Strong potential to own a **distinctive, explainable, and non‑trivially large** niche that incumbents do not already occupy.

### Good (7–8)

- Several workable differentiation angles:
  - Brand can be clearly “best at something” (fastest, healthiest, best for work/study, best desserts, kids‑friendly, best value) while still overlapping on core product.

- Existing players leave room for **format refinement** or **daypart/segment focus** (e.g., commuter‑oriented vs leisure, value vs premium).

### Adequate (5–6)

- Limited but non‑zero differentiation:
  - Most obvious positions are already taken; new concept likely one of many unless execution is outstanding.

- Suitable for demand‑rich nodes where being a “good additional option” is still viable.

### Poor (3–4)

- Hard to differentiate in a way customers care about:
  - Key positions (price, convenience, quality, experience, key daypart) already **strongly owned** by incumbents.

- New concept risks being perceived as generic or redundant.

### Insufficient (0–2)

- No commercially meaningful white‑space:
  - All significant niches are saturated with entrenched players; any possible differentiation is extremely narrow.

---

## 4. Competitive Risk (15%)

Assess how likely and how damaging **competitive responses** might be.

### Excellent (9–10)

- Low competitive risk:
  - Nearby operators are largely complementary or serve different segments.  
  - No dominant direct competitor.

### Good (7–8)

- Some pressure, but manageable:
  - Strong brands exist but are either differentiated or do not heavily overlap in format/price/daypart.

### Adequate (5–6)

- Clear competitive risks:
  - Well‑known chains or powerful local brands with overlapping offerings.  
  - Risk of promotions or copycatting is real but not constant.

### Poor (3–4)

- High competitive risk:
  - Multiple strong incumbents in **very close proximity**; price‑based competition and rapid promotional response are likely.

- New entrant must be significantly better/cheaper/more convenient to win.

### Insufficient (0–2)

- Very high‑risk environment:
  - One or more dominant players with overwhelming advantages (scale, landlord ties, data, subsidy capacity) and a track record of **aggressively defending territory**.

## Competition & Positioning – Recommended Output Format

```json
{
  "score": 5.4,
  "justification": "The area hosts a dense cluster of direct substitutes, some in immediate proximity, and most obvious positioning spaces are partially occupied. Overall demand is strong enough to sustain multiple operators, but the market is share-capture driven and competitive risk from established chains is material, requiring clear differentiation and strong execution."
}
```
