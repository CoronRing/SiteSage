            "customer": "Customer Potential Rubric (Repeat‑Commuter Urban Coffee) – Revised\n\nUse this rubric to score locations 0–10 based on the strength of the **realistically reachable** customer base for a commuter‑focused boutique coffee shop (mainly takeaway).\n\nGeneral principles\n- Evaluate a **single conservative typical weekday**.\n- Use the same fixed **3‑hour morning window** (e.g. 07:30–10:30) for all sites.\n- Base all volume estimates on people passing within **~30–40 m of the storefront along natural paths**, not whole‑station or whole‑mall totals.\n- Always separate:\n  - **repeat, routine users** (commuters, office workers, students, nearby residents using the path ≥ 3 weekdays/week), vs.\n  - **irregular leisure / tourist flows** (occasional shoppers, sightseers, cruise guests, park visitors, etc.).\n- Prioritise **stable repeat flows** over large but irregular tourist traffic.\n- For metro interchanges, only count people who either exit to street near the storefront or walk the specific corridor where the storefront is located; do **not** count pure platform‑to‑platform transfers.\n- For each volume‑based sub‑score, first estimate the share of node‑wide flows that actually pass the storefront zone; **apply this share** before placing the site in a band.\n\nWeights (sum = 100%)\n1. Weekday repeat commuter and office‑worker base – **32%**\n2. Morning‑peak funnel strength (fixed 3‑hour window) – **38%**\n3. All‑day non‑commuter / mall / leisure volume – **3%**\n4. Storefront exposure and path integration – **18%**\n5. Competitive saturation versus effective coffee demand – **4%**\n6. Stability and volatility of flows – **3%**\n7. Demographic and price‑fit quality – **2%**\n\nGlobal caps\n- If weighted average of sub‑scores (1) + (2) < 6.0, overall score cannot exceed **6.0**, regardless of other dimensions.\n- If either sub‑score (1) or (2) < 5.0, overall score cannot exceed **7.0**.\n- If < 50% of total reachable flows (by person‑times) are repeat users, overall score cannot exceed **7.0**.\n\n---\n1. Weekday repeat commuter and office‑worker base (32%)\n\nScope\n- Metro and bus commuters who actually pass the storefront corridor.\n- Office workers and students with regular weekday routines.\n- Nearby residents who **routinely** pass the storefront on workdays.\n\nKey metrics (conservative, typical weekday)\n- **Repeat passers**: distinct person‑times per weekday passing within ~30–40 m of the storefront along natural routes.\n- **Deterministic repeat cups for this store**: conservative all‑day weekday cups from these repeat users (exclude tourists and purely irregular leisure shoppers).\n- Share of node‑wide flows that are true repeat users (≥ 3 weekdays/week).\n\nScore bands (use both volume and cups; if they diverge, place in the lower band)\n- **9.0–10.0 (prime repeat base)**\n  - Node class: clear city‑prime CBD or major sub‑CBD with large office‑tower cluster.\n  - Repeat passers within ~30–40 m: **≥ 45,000 person‑times/weekday**.\n  - Deterministic repeat cups for this store: **≥ 900 cups/weekday**.\n  - ≥ 70% of reachable flows are repeat users.\n\n- **7.5–8.9 (strong repeat node)**\n  - Node class: strong sub‑CBD, concentrated office‑tower area, or high‑intensity station podium.\n  - Repeat passers: **18,000–45,000 person‑times/weekday**.\n  - Deterministic repeat cups: **350–900 cups/weekday**.\n  - ≥ 55% of reachable flows are repeat users.\n\n- **5.0–7.4 (moderate repeat base / community hub)**\n  - Node class: community center, district‑level mall, or mixed residential‑commercial area with some offices.\n  - Repeat passers: **6,000–18,000 person‑times/weekday**.\n  - Deterministic repeat cups: **120–350 cups/weekday**, with at least one strong repeat anchor (office cluster, station, major school).\n\n- **3.0–4.9 (weak repeat base)**\n  - Repeat passers: **2,000–6,000 person‑times/weekday**, or\n  - Deterministic repeat cups: **60–120 cups/weekday**; flows are thin, fragmented, or require detours.\n\n- **0.0–2.9 (insufficient repeat base)**\n  - Repeat passers: **< 2,000 person‑times/weekday**, or\n  - Deterministic repeat cups: **< 60 cups/weekday**.\n\nAdjustments\n- If 50–60% of reachable flows are repeat users, cap this sub‑score at **8.0** even if raw volumes fit a higher band.\n- If < 50% of reachable flows are repeat users, cap this sub‑score at **7.0**.\n- Locations where the majority of repeat passers are **office workers in Grade A/B towers** can be placed **toward the top** of their band; those dominated by low‑frequency community errands should be placed **toward the bottom**.\n\n---\n2. Morning‑peak funnel strength (fixed 3‑hour window) (38%)\n\nScope\n- Concentration and volume of **repeat users** in a fixed 3‑hour morning window (e.g. 07:30–10:30).\n- Passers within ~30–40 m of the storefront, on **natural commuter paths**.\n\nKey metrics (conservative)\n- **Morning repeat passers**: person‑times in the 3‑hour window.\n- **Deterministic morning cups for this store**: conservative cups sold in that window to repeat users.\n- Physical integration with main commuter flows (multi‑line intersections, bus hubs, building lobbies above stations).\n\nScore bands (prioritise cups; use passers as a cross‑check)\n- **9.0–10.0 (prime commuter funnel)**\n  - Morning repeat passers within ~30–40 m: **≥ 12,000 person‑times (3 hours)**, and\n  - Deterministic morning cups: **≥ 600 cups (3 hours)**.\n  - Storefront **directly on, or immediately adjacent (≤ 20–30 m)** to a core commuter path; detour ≤ 30 seconds; no extra security or level changes.\n\n- **7.5–8.9 (strong commuter peak)**\n  - Morning repeat passers: **6,000–12,000 person‑times (3 hours)**, and/or\n  - Deterministic morning cups: **300–600 cups (3 hours)**.\n  - Storefront adjacent (≤ 1 minute detour) to busy station exits, tower lobbies, or main street commuter corridors, with clear sightlines.\n\n- **5.0–7.4 (moderate morning peak)**\n  - Morning repeat passers: **2,000–6,000 person‑times (3 hours)**, or\n  - Deterministic morning cups: **100–300 cups (3 hours)**.\n  - Flows present but less compressed, partly off‑path, or tied mainly to a district‑level node.\n\n- **3.0–4.9 (limited morning peak)**\n  - Morning repeat passers: **700–2,000 person‑times (3 hours)**, or\n  - Deterministic morning cups: **30–100 cups (3 hours)**; commuters are scattered or must detour noticeably.\n\n- **0.0–2.9 (no meaningful morning peak)**\n  - Morning repeat passers: **< 700 person‑times (3 hours)**, or\n  - Deterministic morning cups: **< 30 cups (3 hours)**.\n\nAdjustments\n- If morning flows in the corridor are dominated by **irregular tourists or one‑off leisure visitors**, reduce this sub‑score by **1.0–1.5** within the band.\n- Do **not** assign a prime commuter band score based solely on whole‑station totals; first estimate what share of station flows uses the specific exit and path in front of the storefront.\n- When two locations have similar passers but one has a **much higher proportion of office‑tower commuters**, place that site **higher within the same band**.\n\n---\n3. All‑day non‑commuter / mall / leisure volume (3%)\n\nScope\n- Shoppers, tourists, hotel guests, park users, and other **irregular** visitors.\n- Focus on incremental value beyond the repeat commuter/office base.\n\nKey metrics (conservative)\n- **Reachable leisure passers**: person‑times per weekday within ~30–40 m linked to malls, attractions, hotels, or leisure streets (excluding the repeat users already counted).\n- **Conservative incremental cups** from these users (all‑day weekday), excluding repeat commuters.\n\nScore bands\n- **9.0–10.0 (very strong leisure base)**\n  - Reachable leisure passers: **≥ 60,000 person‑times/weekday**.\n  - Incremental deterministic cups from leisure users: **≥ 250 cups/weekday**.\n\n- **7.5–8.9 (strong leisure base)**\n  - Reachable leisure passers: **25,000–60,000 person‑times/weekday**.\n  - Incremental deterministic cups: **100–250 cups/weekday**.\n\n- **5.0–7.4 (moderate leisure base)**\n  - Reachable leisure passers: **8,000–25,000 person‑times/weekday**, or\n  - Incremental deterministic cups: **30–100 cups/weekday**.\n\n- **3.0–4.9 (weak leisure base)**\n  - Reachable leisure passers: **3,000–8,000 person‑times/weekday**, or\n  - Incremental deterministic cups: **10–30 cups/weekday**.\n\n- **0.0–2.9 (minimal leisure base)**\n  - Reachable leisure passers: **< 3,000 person‑times/weekday**, or\n  - Incremental deterministic cups: **< 10 cups/weekday**.\n\nNotes\n- Do not let this sub‑score compensate for a weak repeat commuter and office base (see global caps).\n- In tourist‑heavy corridors, be conservative with conversion rates and do not assume repeat behaviour.\n\n---\n4. Storefront exposure and path integration (18%)\n\nScope\n- How much of the node's relevant traffic **naturally passes the door**.\n- Micro‑placement within malls, podiums, and street grids.\n\nKey measures\n- Share of relevant flows (repeat + leisure) that pass within ~20–30 m of the storefront with clear sightlines.\n- Need for level changes, security checks, or long detours.\n\nScore bands\n- **9.0–10.0 (highly exposed)**\n  - Storefront on a **main pedestrian conduit** (core mall spine, building lobby throat, main station corridor, or unavoidable street path).\n  - **≥ 50%** of relevant repeat flows pass within ~30 m with clear visibility.\n  - Detour from primary commuter path **≤ 1 minute**; no extra security checks or complex vertical circulation.\n\n- **7.5–8.9 (good exposure)**\n  - Near main flows; **25–50%** of relevant repeat flows pass within ~30 m, or\n  - Detour ≤ 2 minutes with clear visibility and one simple level change (direct escalator/elevator).\n\n- **5.0–7.4 (moderate exposure)**\n  - On a secondary corridor; **10–25%** of relevant repeat flows pass naturally, or\n  - Detour 2–4 minutes and/or one significant level change or security barrier.\n\n- **3.0–4.9 (low exposure)**\n  - Hidden on upper/basement/back corridors; **< 10%** of relevant flows pass by; detour > 4 minutes or multiple level changes.\n\n- **0.0–2.9 (very poor exposure)**\n  - Isolated or back‑of‑house; almost all visitors must come intentionally; negligible spontaneous pass‑by.\n\nNote\n- When estimating repeat volumes in sub‑scores (1) and (2), you must **explicitly apply** the exposure share from this sub‑score to node‑level flows before assigning bands.\n\n---\n5. Competitive saturation versus effective coffee demand (4%)\n\nScope\n- Balance between deterministic node coffee demand and direct competition.\n\nDefinitions\n- **Direct competitors**: branded or specialty coffee outlets and convenience formats selling espresso‑based drinks within ~100–150 m along the same main paths.\n- **Deterministic node coffee demand**: conservative estimate of total weekday coffee cups that all operators combined can sustainably sell from reachable flows (based on observed or modelled conversion rates).\n\nKey metrics\n- Approximate **cups/day per coffee store on the main flows**.\n\nScore bands\n- **9.0–10.0 (high demand, manageable competition)**\n  - Deterministic node coffee demand: **≥ 3,000 cups/weekday**.\n  - ≤ 5 strong direct competitors sharing the same main flows.\n  - A new store can plausibly reach **≥ 15% market share** without severe price pressure.\n\n- **7.5–8.9 (balanced)**\n  - Deterministic node coffee demand: **1,500–3,000 cups/weekday**.\n  - 4–9 direct competitors; sustainable volume per operator remains healthy.\n\n- **5.0–7.4 (tight)**\n  - Deterministic node coffee demand: **700–1,500 cups/weekday**, or\n  - ≥ 8 direct competitors on the same main paths; a new entrant likely captures only modest share unless strongly differentiated.\n\n- **3.0–4.9 (over‑supplied)**\n  - Deterministic node coffee demand: **< 700 cups/weekday** with many established competitors, or\n  - Clear evidence of weak performance or closures among similar coffee outlets on the same flows.\n\n- **0.0–2.9 (unsustainable)**\n  - Very low demand and high competition; a new store is unlikely to reach viable volumes even with strong execution.\n\nAdjustments\n- In tourist‑heavy corridors with dense coffee clustering, reduce this sub‑score by **0.5–1.0** within the band unless there is clear unmet morning‑peak demand from repeat commuters.\n\n---\n6. Stability and volatility of flows (3%)\n\nScope\n- Long‑term predictability of reachable demand in the specific corridors feeding the storefront.\n\nConsider\n- Maturity and trajectory of the commercial node.\n- Dependence on single anchors (one mall, one office tower, one tourist attraction).\n- Visible signs of growth or decline along the actual paths that feed the store.\n\nScore bands\n- **9.0–10.0 (very stable with upside)**\n  - Mature or rising CBD/sub‑CBD with strong long‑term anchors (large offices, major transit, established malls) on the same paths as the storefront.\n  - No visible major risks that would significantly reduce corridor footfall.\n\n- **7.5–8.9 (stable)**\n  - Generally stable with some upside from new projects or improvements; limited short‑term disruptions; anchors diversified.\n\n- **5.0–7.4 (neutral or uncertain)**\n  - Anchors present but mixed signals: aging mall, visible vacancies, repositioning works, or partial reliance on cyclical tourist or event flows.\n\n- **3.0–4.9 (negative bias)**\n  - Evidence of declining performance (shrinking tenant mix, repeated closures, or office/transit shifting away).\n\n- **0.0–2.9 (high deterioration risk)**\n  - High likelihood of structural decline in reachable demand due to major anchor exits, transit re‑routing, or sustained adverse policy impacts.\n\n---\n7. Demographic and price‑fit quality (2%)\n\nScope\n- Match between reachable repeat users and typical boutique/specialty coffee customers in age, income, and habits.\n\nConsider\n- Share of reachable repeat base that is working‑age white‑collar, students, or younger professionals.\n- Surrounding tenant mix and price positioning of nearby F&B and retail as a proxy for disposable income and coffee habit.\n\nScore bands\n- **9.0–10.0 (excellent fit)**\n  - **≥ 60%** of reachable repeat users are target segments with clear discretionary spending (office workers, young professionals, students).\n  - Surrounding tenant mix skewed to mid/high‑end brands and visible existing coffee culture (multiple specialty or international chains with stable presence).\n\n- **7.5–8.9 (good fit)**\n  - **40–60%** of reachable repeat users fit the target profile; income levels supportive; some visible coffee habit.\n\n- **5.0–7.4 (mixed fit)**\n  - **25–40%** fit the target; a large share of nearby population is elderly, lower‑income, or infrequent coffee drinkers; some adaptation of product/price may be needed.\n\n- **3.0–4.9 (weak fit)**\n  - **10–25%** fit the target; most locals are unlikely to buy specialty coffee frequently; better suited to value formats.\n\n- **0.0–2.9 (poor fit)**\n  - **< 10%** of reachable repeat users fit the specialty coffee target; format largely misaligned with local demand.\n",

Effective Node Volume (RSV proxy) – 65%\n\n1.1 Required inputs\n- **Effective passers (by daypart, within 0–50 m of frontage)**\n  - Morning peak (7:30–10:30) – only people passing within ~0–50 m on real desire lines.\n  - Other dayparts (lunch, afternoon, evening) – only if flows pass within ~0–50 m.\n- **Daily-path base (0–100 m)**\n  - Office workers, students, mall staff whose **daily path** passes within 0–100 m.\n  - Residents within 800–1,000 m who are likely **weekly visitors** to this node.\n- **Coffee penetration assumptions (daily buyers among relevant users)**\n  - Mature CBD / dense office cluster: **8–10%**.\n  - Strong mixed-use mall + offices: **6–8%**.\n  - Community / weaker coffee culture: **3–6%**.\n- **New-store share assumptions (of total coffee volume at node)**\n  - Heavy saturation, many strong brands on same corridor: **3–6%**.\n  - Moderate competition, good micro-position: **6–10%**.\n  - Light competition, strong micro-position: **10–15%**.\n  - Adjust down if micro-position off main line or detour >3 min vs peers.\n\n1.2 Estimating RSV (step-by-step)\n- Step 1 – **Effective daily users**\n  - Start from morning 0–50 m flows; add other dayparts that also pass 0–50 m (use conservative estimates, avoid counting whole-station entries).\n- Step 2 – **Theoretical coffee volume**\n  - Theoretical cups/day = effective users × appropriate penetration % (use mid-point of range).\n- Step 3 – **New-store share**\n  - Choose share band based on competition and micro-position.\n  - Reduce share if multiple similar brands sit directly on same 0–50 m path.\n- Step 4 – **RSV (realistic sustainable cups/day)**\n  - RSV = theoretical cups/day × new-store share.\n  - Cross-check vs observed benchmarks for similar brands at the node.\n\n1.3 Scoring bands (by RSV)\n- **Excellent (9.0–10.0)**\n  - RSV ≥ 1,000 cups/day.\n- **Very strong (8.0–8.9)**\n  - RSV 800–999 cups/day.\n- **Strong (7.0–7.9)**\n  - RSV 600–799 cups/day.\n- **Upper-adequate (6.0–6.9)**\n  - RSV 450–599 cups/day.\n- **Adequate (5.0–5.9)**\n  - RSV 350–449 cups/day.\n- **Weak (4.0–4.9)**\n  - RSV 250–349 cups/day.\n- **Failing / Marginal (0.0–3.9)**\n  - RSV < 250 cups/day.\n\n1.4 Guardrails & sensitivity\n- If **effective morning peak passers within 0–50 m ≥ 12,000** and per-capita competition (see 2.2) is not extreme (>4 outlets per 10k users):\n  - Effective Node Volume score should normally be **≥ 7.5** even if competition is dense.\n- If effective morning peak passers within 0–50 m are **6,000–11,999** and RSV **450–699**:\n  - Score should normally be **≥ 6.5**.\n- If effective morning peak passers within 0–50 m **≤ 4,000** and RSV **≤ 350**:\n  - Score should normally be **≤ 6.0**.\n- **Cross-location sensitivity (same city / decision set):**\n  - If two locations’ estimated RSV differ by a factor **≥ 2.0**, their Effective Node Volume scores must differ by **≥ 2.0 points** in the same direction.\n  - If RSV ratio is **1.5–2.0**, their Effective Node Volume scores must differ by **≥ 1.0 point** in the same direction.\n\n---\n2. Saturation & Per-capita Competition – 15%\n\n2.1 Inputs\n- Count **direct substitutes** (coffee-first; plus bakeries/tea that realistically capture morning coffee) in rings:\n  - 0–25 m – same frontage / same immediate cluster.\n  - 25–100 m – same corridor or side of main street.\n  - 100–300 m – same node, short walk.\n- Within 300 m, estimate **effective daily users** who can reach with ≤3 min detour (from Section 1 inputs).\n- Compute **per-capita density**:\n  - Direct coffee outlets (including coffee-strong bakeries) **per 10,000 effective daily users**.\n- Note **qualitative saturation signals**:\n  - Many quiet or visibly weak units.\n  - Heavy, persistent discounting.\n  - Recent closures on same corridor.\n\n2.2 Scoring bands (combine absolute counts + per-capita)\n- **Excellent (9.0–10.0)**\n  - ≤ 3 direct coffee outlets within 100 m; and\n  - ≤ 10 direct coffee outlets within 300 m; and\n  - ≤ 1.5 direct outlets per 10k effective daily users; and\n  - Few/no weak or empty units.\n- **Good (7.0–8.9)**\n  - 4–6 direct outlets within 100 m; or\n  - 11–18 within 300 m; and\n  - 1.6–2.5 outlets per 10k effective users; and\n  - Most units healthy, no clear oversupply.\n- **Adequate (5.0–6.9)**\n  - 7–9 direct outlets within 100 m; or\n  - 19–30 within 300 m; or\n  - 2.6–3.5 outlets per 10k effective users;\n  - Node still has strong Effective Node Volume (score ≥ 6.5) and most peers appear healthy.\n- **Poor (3.0–4.9)**\n  - ≥ 10 direct outlets within 100 m; or\n  - 31–45 within 300 m; or\n  - > 3.5 outlets per 10k effective users; or\n  - Clear signs that additional similar stores mostly cannibalise share (weak units despite good traffic).\n- **Extreme saturation (0.0–2.9)**\n  - > 50 coffee-related outlets within 500 m; and\n  - Multiple visibly weak or half-empty coffee units on same main flows; and\n  - Per-capita density clearly above sustainable norms (> 4.5 direct outlets per 10k effective users).\n\n2.3 Scale-sensitive notes\n- In **very high-volume CBD nodes** with many outlets but still healthy peers, do **not** automatically push this score into 0–2 range; use **3–5** unless there is evidence of structural oversupply.\n- In **medium-volume suburban/commercial nodes** with much lower effective passers, similar outlet counts should be penalized **more harshly** via per-capita density.\n\n---\n3. Positioning White Space – 10%\n\n3.1 Checks\n- **Coverage by incumbent formats on same main flows (0–100 m)**\n  - Value commuter chains (Luckin/Cotti-style).\n  - Mass specialty (Manner-style).\n  - Global brands (Starbucks/Costa/Tims).\n  - Premium boutiques / design cafés.\n  - Brunch/bakery sit-down with strong coffee.\n- **Daypart coverage** by incumbents (7–9 am commute, lunch, afternoon, evening).\n- **Potential roles for new store on same flows**\n  - Fastest high-quality commuter option (order-to-drink ≤ 60–90 sec) with clear proof of speed vs peers.\n  - Distinctive product / roast / flavor profile that is clearly different from nearby chains.\n  - Only or clearly best option for a specific sizeable niche (e.g., serious coffee + grab-and-go breakfast on that corridor).\n- Estimate **incremental uplift** from differentiation vs being a generic follower (cups/day).\n\n3.2 Scoring bands\n- **Excellent (9.0–10.0)**\n  - Clear structural white space on main flows (0–50 m), e.g.:\n    - No truly fast commuter-focused specialty outlet; or\n    - No serious specialty-quality player despite obvious quality-seeking base.\n  - Plausible incremental uplift from differentiation **≥ 400–500 cups/day** vs a generic offer.\n- **Good (7.0–8.9)**\n  - 1–2 strong, monetizable differentiation angles despite similar brands; visible pain points (queues, slow service, weak breakfast, tourist-only focus).\n  - Incremental potential ≈ **250–400 cups/day**.\n- **Adequate (5.0–6.9)**\n  - Some white space but narrow or execution-dependent; most price/format slots are already covered.\n  - Incremental potential ≈ **150–250 cups/day**.\n- **Poor (3.0–4.9)**\n  - All major positions (value commuter, mass specialty, premium sit-down, design boutique, breakfast+coffee) already held by 2+ strong players on same flows.\n  - Incremental potential likely **≤ 150 cups/day**.\n- **Insufficient (0.0–2.9)**\n  - No credible, monetizable white space; new store is effectively redundant on the corridor.\n\n3.3 Volume-linked caps\n- If Effective Node Volume score **≤ 4.0** (RSV < 350):\n  - Positioning White Space score should normally be **≤ 6.0**.\n- If Effective Node Volume score **≤ 3.0** (RSV < 250):\n  - Positioning White Space score should normally be **≤ 5.0**.\n\n---\n4. Anchor / Incumbent Risk – 10%\n\n4.1 Inputs\n- Presence and proximity (0–100 m) of **top-tier brands on same flows**:\n  - Starbucks (especially Reserve/flagship), Manner, Luckin, Cotti, M Stand, Peet's, %Arabica, Blue Bottle, major bakery-café anchors.\n- **Hero or flagship units**:\n  - Reserve/Roastery, iconic specialty bars, landmark kiosks directly on main exits.\n- **Depth of clustering** of strong brands around the site (how many within 0–50 m and 50–100 m on main paths).\n- **Competitive behaviour**:\n  - Aggressive digital promotions, large app ecosystems, delivery dominance, corporate tie-ups.\n\n4.2 Scoring bands\n- **Excellent (9.0–10.0)**\n  - No top-tier chains within 50 m on main flows; and\n  - At most 1–2 within 100 m, with clearly different price tiers or primary dayparts.\n- **Good (7.0–8.9)**\n  - 1–2 strong chains within 50 m with only partial overlap; or\n  - 3–4 within 100 m but mixed formats (e.g., more sit-down, more tourist focus) and strong node volume.\n- **Adequate (5.0–6.9)**\n  - 2–3 strong chains within 50 m, overlapping some core use cases; or\n  - 5–6 within 100 m, but no single hero flagship directly on top of the site.\n- **Poor (3.0–4.9)**\n  - ≥ 1 hero/flagship unit (e.g., Reserve, iconic flagship) within 25 m **directly overlapping** target use; and/or\n  - ≥ 4 strong chains within 50 m or ≥ 7 within 100 m on same flows.\n- **Extreme (0.0–2.9)**\n  - Hero/flagship unit essentially co-located (0–10 m) plus multiple strong chains (≥ 3) within 50 m on same flow; or\n  - Clear pattern of similar entrants failing recently on the same frontage.\n\n4.3 Scale-sensitive notes\n- In **extremely large nodes** with very high RSV (≥ 900), strong anchors still matter but should not fully override volume:\n  - Do not raise this dimension above **6.0** if a hero/flagship is co-located on the same flow.\n\n---\n5. Gates and Cross-node Consistency\n\n5.1 RSV-based caps on final score\n- If Effective Node Volume score **≤ 2.9** (RSV < 250):\n  - Cap final score at **4.5**.\n- If Effective Node Volume score **3.0–3.9** (RSV 250–299):\n  - Cap final score at **5.5**.\n- If Effective Node Volume score **4.0–4.4** (RSV 300–349):\n  - Cap final score at **6.5**.\n\n5.2 Extreme anchor override caps\n- If there is a **hero/flagship unit within 0–10 m** directly overlapping the new store's core use; and\n  - There are **≥ 3 other strong chains within 50 m**, or **≥ 6 within 100 m** on the same flows:\n    - Cap final score at **6.5**.\n- If there is a hero/flagship within 0–25 m and Saturation & Per-capita Competition score **≤ 4.0**:\n  - Cap final score at **7.0**.\n\n5.3 Protection for very strong, less-saturated nodes\n- If Effective Node Volume score **≥ 8.0** and Saturation & Per-capita Competition score **≥ 5.0**:\n  - Do not cap final score below **7.0** solely due to anchor presence.\n\n5.4 Cross-node spread rules (same city / same decision set)\n- Define RSV bands by daily cups:\n  - Band A: < 250\n  - Band B: 250–349\n  - Band C: 350–449\n  - Band D: 450–599\n  - Band E: 600–799\n  - Band F: ≥ 800\n- When comparing two locations:\n  - If they fall **two or more bands apart** (e.g., B vs D, C vs E):\n    - Their final scores should differ by **≥ 2.0 points** in the direction of the higher RSV.\n  - If they fall in **adjacent bands** (e.g., C vs D):\n    - Their final scores should differ by **≥ 1.0 point** in the direction of the higher RSV.\n  - If RSV ratio **≥ 2.0 or ≤ 0.5**:\n    - Avoid giving final scores whose **ratio is < 1.3** in the opposite direction or nearly flat.\n\n5.5 Application notes (for report writers)\n- Always base Effective Node Volume on **0–50 m flows by daypart**, not entire-station or district traffic.\n- Treat **time-based catchments (e.g., 5–10 min walk)** only as support for understanding where users come from, not as direct substitutes for 0–50 m passers.\n- In highly saturated CBD / flagship clusters with 40–70 coffee-related outlets in 500 m, default to **low new-store share** unless there is quantified evidence for higher share – but still respect very high effective traffic.\n- In dense office clusters with high effective passers and fewer outlets per user, allow RSV and final scores to be **meaningfully higher** than in mid-volume suburban malls with similar raw outlet counts."

The score represents how attractive the **competitive structure** is, *after* adjusting for node scale (traffic and demand). High-traffic hubs with healthy per-store demand should not be penalized into very low scores purely for having many outlets.\n\n## Dimension weights (sum = 100%)\n\n1. **Demand–Supply Balance (scale‑adjusted)** – 35%\n2. **Competitor Density & Micro‑Proximity** – 20%\n3. **Positioning Opportunity (white space & fit)** – 25%\n4. **Incumbent Power & Reaction Risk** – 20%\n\n---\n\n## 1. Demand–Supply Balance (scale‑adjusted) – 35%\n\nGoal: Match aggregate category supply to **traffic‑scaled demand**, using **per‑outlet demand potential** as the core metric.\n\n### Estimation inputs\n- **Relevant daily users** in catchment (typ. within 500–800 m):\n  - Commuters (station entries/exits, bus),\n  - Office workers,\n  - Mall/shopping visitors,\n  - Residents (only a fraction are daily users).\n- **Category penetration** baseline (coffee/tea/quick service in strong hubs): usually **5–10%** of relevant daily users per day.\n- **Total category outlets** in radius (dedicated + strong substitutes).\n- **Per‑outlet demand potential** ≈ (relevant daily users × assumed penetration) ÷ number of active outlets.\n\n### Scoring bands (coffee / high‑frequency beverages)\n\n**Excellent (9–10)**\n- Per‑outlet demand potential **≥700 transactions/day** *and*:\n  - Multiple incumbents show **sustained queues** or high throughput in key dayparts **without heavy discounting**, and\n  - Little evidence of weak or empty outlets.\n- Typical of **very strong hubs** (e.g., large metro interchange + major mall) where even dozens of outlets appear healthy.\n\n**Good (7–8.9)**\n- Per‑outlet demand potential **≈500–699/day**, or higher with mixed performance:\n  - Most incumbents appear **busy in peak hours**;\n  - Some discounting and average performers but **few obvious under‑utilized stores**.\n- New entrants can grow **without severe cannibalization**, especially with differentiation.\n\n**Adequate (5–6.9)**\n- Per‑outlet demand potential **≈350–499/day**:\n  - Clear **balance** between supply and demand;\n  - Mix of busy and moderate stores; some reliance on **promos**, but not extreme.\n- New entrants must **take share** and/or leverage sharper positioning.\n\n**Poor (3–4.9)**\n- Per‑outlet demand potential **≈250–349/day**, and at least one of:\n  - Several outlets visibly **under‑utilized**, even in prime slots;\n  - Frequent **deep discounting** is needed to drive volume;\n  - Recent closures or rapid churn of similar formats.\n\n**Insufficient (0–2.9)**\n- Per‑outlet demand potential **<250/day**, or category appears **shrinking/over‑built**:\n  - Many weak stores, empty in peak times, or repeated failures.\n\n### Hub‑scale adjustment (protects strong nodes like Report1)\n- If **relevant daily users ≥200,000** *and* estimated per‑outlet demand potential **≥500/day**, then:\n  - Demand–Supply Balance score should **rarely be <7.0**, unless there is strong evidence of systematic underperformance (empty stores, heavy closures).\n- If **relevant daily users ≤80,000** with similar outlet counts and per‑outlet demand **<400/day**, scores should lean toward **≤6.0** even if reports don’t show obvious distress.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Competitor Density & Micro‑Proximity – 20%\n\nGoal: Capture **how crowded the immediate micro‑corridors are**, adjusting for node scale. Focus on **direct substitutes on the same flows** and **competitors per 10k relevant daily users**.\n\n### Key measures\n- **Direct substitutes** within ≈300–500 m.\n- **Micro‑cluster** on same main flows (same concourse, corridor, podium, block front):\n  - Count of direct outlets within **0–25 m**, **25–100 m**, **100–300 m**.\n- **Density per traffic**: direct outlets within ≈300 m per **10,000 relevant daily users**.\n\n### Scoring bands\n\n**Excellent (9–10)**\n- Light or moderate density after **scale adjustment**:\n  - ≤**1.0 direct outlet per 10k relevant daily users** within ≈300 m; and\n  - No major direct competitor within **50 m** on the same primary path.\n\n**Good (7–8.9)**\n- Noticeable but manageable density:\n  - **1.0–2.0** direct outlets per 10k relevant daily users within ≈300 m; and\n  - At most **one** direct substitute within **25 m**, and ≤**3** within **100 m** on same desire lines.\n\n**Adequate (5–6.9)**\n- High density typical of major hubs, but still consistent with healthy demand:\n  - **2.0–3.0** direct outlets per 10k relevant daily users within ≈300 m; or\n  - Several direct substitutes in same building/podium (**3–5 within 100 m**), **but** Demand–Supply Balance is **≥6.5** and most operators seem healthy.\n\n**Poor (3–4.9)**\n- **Tight micro‑clustering** on the same flows:\n  - **>3.0** direct outlets per 10k relevant daily users within ≈300 m; or\n  - **≥3** direct substitutes within **25 m** *or* **≥6** within **100 m** on primary corridors.\n- Best‑visible spots are mostly held by incumbents, new entrant likely relegated to **inferior frontage**.\n\n**Insufficient (0–2.9)**\n- Extreme crowding on the exact same paths **and** evidence the node is not scaling with it:\n  - Very high counts on single corridors **plus** weak / empty units.\n\n### Revised mall hyper‑cluster rule (weakened blanket penalty)\n- **If** inside the same mall/podium and within ≈150 m there are **≥4 branded chain coffee/tea units + ≥3 bakery/dessert cafés** *and* Demand–Supply Balance is **≤5.5**, then:\n  - Competitor Density & Micro‑Proximity score should usually be **≤3.5**.\n- **If** Demand–Supply Balance is **>6.5** (very strong hub with good per‑store demand), density score can be **5.0–6.5** even with such clusters (as in Report1‑type locations).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Positioning Opportunity (white space & fit) – 25%\n\nGoal: Assess **room to differentiate** on price, quality, speed, assortment, experience, and daypart focus. Emphasize **practical, monetizable white space**, especially in high‑traffic hubs.\n\n### Key checks\n- Are **all major price tiers** (value / mid / premium / luxury) already crowded by strong brands?\n- Are **all key formats** (express commuter, sit‑down third space, serious specialty, dessert‑driven) present on the same flows?\n- Are specific **dayparts** (early morning 7–9, late evening, weekends) underserved?\n- Does the proposed concept have a **sharp and credible edge** (e.g., “fast boutique commuter” positioned between value chains and slow third spaces)?\n\n### Scoring bands\n\n**Excellent (9–10)**\n- Clear **and sizable** white spaces:\n  - Missing or weak representation at your **exact intended positioning** (e.g., high‑throughput, high‑quality commuter kiosk at a major exit where existing options are slow or value‑only);\n  - Or a **major daypart gap** (e.g., most cafes open late in a strong 7–9 am node).\n- The concept can plausibly become **best‑in‑class on ≥1 critical dimension** (fastest, best quality, most convenient) with clear evidence.\n\n**Good (7–8.9)**\n- Several **credible differentiation angles**:\n  - Similar formats exist, but none combine your specific **price + quality + speed + daypart** mix;\n  - Incumbents show **visible pain points** (queues too long, space too small, limited breakfast, generic taste).\n- New concept likely to become a **top‑choice for a defined niche** (e.g., commuters who want better coffee than value chains, but faster than third spaces).\n\n**Adequate (5–6.9)**\n- White space exists but is **narrow**, or heavily execution‑dependent:\n  - Major positions on **price and format** are already taken by strong brands;\n  - Differentiation relies mostly on **doing the same thing better**, not on a clear structural gap.\n\n**Poor (3–4.9)**\n- Hard to stand out:\n  - Each obvious niche (value commuter, mass specialty, premium sit‑down, design‑driven boutique) is already **strongly claimed** by brands with high loyalty and good access.\n- The concept risks being perceived as a **weaker copy** of an existing operator.\n\n**Insufficient (0–2.9)**\n- **No credible positioning space**:\n  - All key combinations of **price × quality × speed × format** are covered by powerful incumbents;\n  - Little sign of unmet customer needs.\n\n### Clustered‑mall adjustment (more granular)\n- In interior malls/podiums where **2+ strong chains at similar tiers** already sit on the main commuter corridors:\n  - Apply a **downward adjustment of 0.5–1.0 points** vs a comparable street node, **unless** the concept has explicit white space in **speed (express commuter)** or **daypart**.\n- Conversely, if reports show a **clear operational gap** (e.g., all neighbors slow or focused on sit‑down; your model is optimized to **≤2–3 min** total journey or **≤60–90 s** drink time), increase Positioning Opportunity by **+0.5–1.0** within the band.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Incumbent Power & Reaction Risk – 20%\n\nGoal: Assess how **dangerous nearby incumbents are**, in terms of brand strength, landlord ties, corporate contracts, and their likely response to a new entrant.\n\n### Key checks\n- Number and proximity of **top‑tier brands** (e.g., Starbucks, Manner, Luckin, Cotti, M Stand, Peet’s, major bakery‑cafés) within **0–100 m**.\n- Presence of any **flagship/hero units** (Reserve/roastery, specialty halo stores).\n- Landlord alignment (e.g., mall curated mix vs open to many similar tenants).\n- Evidence of **aggressive discounting or promotions** in response to new entrants.\n\n### Scoring bands\n\n**Excellent (9–10)**\n- Low competitive threat:\n  - Nearby operators are mostly **complementary** or in **different tiers/formats**;\n  - Few or no top‑tier chains within **50 m**.\n\n**Good (7–8.9)**\n- Some strong brands nearby, but **partial overlap only**:\n  - 1–2 major chains within **50–100 m**, yet targeting different dayparts, formats, or price tiers.\n  - Landlord mix appears **balanced**, not dominated by a single chain.\n\n**Adequate (5–6.9)**\n- Clear competitive risk but manageable:\n  - **2–3 strong chains** within **50–100 m** sharing peak dayparts;\n  - No single, dominant “hero unit” with outsized halo in the **exact same use case**.\n\n**Poor (3–4.9)**\n- High risk from **clustered, powerful incumbents**:\n  - **≥3 strong chains** within **50 m**, or **≥5** within **100 m**, directly overlapping in price and daypart (e.g., value + mass specialty + premium all targeting morning commuters);\n  - Known tendency to respond with **deep promos** or corporate deals.\n\n**Insufficient (0–2.9)**\n- Extremely high‑risk:\n  - One or more **flagship/hero units** of top competitors in the same podium/building **plus** landlord preference or exclusivity patterns that favor them;\n  - History of new entrants failing rapidly.\n\n### Revised hard‑rules (more scale‑sensitive)\n- If a flagship/hero unit (Reserve, roastery, or iconic specialty cafe) is within **≤25 m** and **directly overlaps** your core use case, this sub‑score should usually be **≤4.5**, **unless** Demand–Supply Balance is **≥7.5** and Positioning Opportunity is **≥7.5** (large hub with a clear, differentiated niche).\n- In dense interior clusters (as in both reports):\n  - If there are **≥4 strong chains** within **100 m** on the same commuter flows, Competitive Risk should typically be **≤5.5**;\n  - Push toward **≤4.0** only when there is evidence of aggressive defensive behavior, limited landlord openness, or repeated failures of similar concepts.\n",

Demand–Supply Balance (scale & per‑outlet) – 45%\n\n**Goal:** Measure how much **realistic daily volume per store** is available, given traffic and number of outlets. This is the primary driver of score.\n\n### 1.1 Required inputs\n\n- **Relevant daily users** (within 500–800 m, or main catchment):  \n  - Commuters (station entries/exits, major bus),  \n  - Office workers actually passing nearby,  \n  - Mall / shopping visitors who pass the frontage,  \n  - Nearby residents (only a fraction counted as daily users).\n- **Category penetration** for coffee / high‑frequency beverages in strong urban nodes:  \n  - Use **5–10%** of relevant daily users as default range;  \n  - Use 3–5% if local habits are weaker.\n- **Total relevant outlets**: number of active stores serving the same primary use (coffee/tea/breakfast quick service + obvious substitutes) within ~500 m.\n- **Per‑outlet demand potential** (central metric):  \n  - = (relevant daily users × realistic penetration%) ÷ total relevant outlets.  \n  - Use a **midpoint** scenario (e.g., 7% if 5–10% range) for scoring bands.\n\n### 1.2 Scoring bands (coffee / high‑frequency beverages)\n\nUse per‑outlet demand potential as the anchor; adjust ±0.5–1.0 points if there is strong on‑site evidence (queues / obvious emptiness / closures).\n\n- **Excellent (9.0–10.0)**  \n  - Per‑outlet demand potential **≥800 transactions/day**; or **≥650/day** with clear evidence of:  \n    - Multiple incumbents showing **sustained queues or visible crowding** in key dayparts **without extreme discounting**, and  \n    - Very few clearly weak or empty stores.  \n  - Typical of very strong hubs where even many outlets appear healthy.\n\n- **Good (7.0–8.9)**  \n  - Per‑outlet demand potential **550–799/day**, or **500–549/day** with strong evidence that most incumbents trade well (busy peaks, no obvious dead units).  \n  - New entrant can reach **≥500/day** with solid execution and differentiation.\n\n- **Adequate (5.0–6.9)**  \n  - Per‑outlet demand potential **400–549/day**.  \n  - Mix of busy and average stores; some reliance on discounts, but not extreme.  \n  - New entrant likely needs to **take share** or run very efficiently; volume of **~350–600/day** is plausible but not easy.\n\n- **Weak (3.0–4.9)**  \n  - Per‑outlet demand potential **250–399/day**, and at least one of:  \n    - Several outlets clearly **under‑utilized** even in peak hours;  \n    - Frequent **deep discounting** or heavy coupons to move volume;  \n    - Recent closures / churn of similar formats.  \n  - New entrant must expect **hard share‑taking** and struggle to exceed **250–400/day** without displacing others.\n\n- **Failing / Over‑built (0.0–2.9)**  \n  - Per‑outlet demand potential **<250/day**, or visible **over‑build**:  \n    - Many outlets quiet or empty even at peaks;  \n    - Clear signs of repeated failures or heavy turnover;  \n    - Heavy permanent discounting across many brands.  \n  - New entrant faces **structural oversupply**; reaching sustainable volume is unlikely.\n\n### 1.3 Hub‑scale adjustment (weaker than before)\n\n- If **relevant daily users ≥200,000** *and* per‑outlet demand potential **≥550/day**, Demand–Supply Balance score should **normally be ≥7.0**, unless on‑site observation contradicts (many visibly weak units).  \n- If per‑outlet demand potential is **<400/day**, **do not uprate** just because the node is large: score should follow the bands above, even in huge hubs.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Competitor Density & Micro‑Proximity – 20%\n\n**Goal:** Capture how **crowded the same flows** are, after adjusting for traffic scale. Focus on:\n- Direct substitutes within ≈300–500 m,\n- **Micro‑clusters** on the same corridors / concourses / street front,\n- Outlets **per 10,000 relevant daily users**.\n\n### 2.1 Key measurements\n\n- Count of **direct substitutes** (same primary use: coffee/tea/breakfast quick service) within:  \n  - **0–25 m**,  \n  - **25–100 m**,  \n  - **100–300 m**.\n- Compute **density per traffic** within ~300 m:  \n  - Direct outlets ÷ (relevant daily users / 10,000) = outlets per 10k users.\n\n### 2.2 Scoring bands\n\n- **Excellent (9.0–10.0)**  \n  - Light or moderate density after scale adjustment:  \n    - ≤**1.0** direct outlet per **10k** relevant daily users within ≈300 m; and  \n    - No major direct competitor within **50 m** on the same primary path.\n\n- **Good (7.0–8.9)**  \n  - Noticeable but manageable density:  \n    - **1.0–2.0** direct outlets per 10k relevant daily users within ≈300 m; and  \n    - At most **1** direct substitute within **25 m**, and ≤**3** within **100 m** on the same desire lines.\n\n- **Adequate (5.0–6.9)**  \n  - High density typical of major hubs, but still consistent with healthy demand:  \n    - **2.0–3.0** direct outlets per 10k relevant daily users within ≈300 m; or  \n    - Several direct substitutes in the same building/podium (**3–5 within 100 m**), **and** Demand–Supply Balance is **≥6.5**.\n\n- **Poor (3.0–4.9)**  \n  - **Tight micro‑clustering** on the same flows:  \n    - **>3.0** direct outlets per 10k relevant daily users within ≈300 m; or  \n    - **≥3** direct substitutes within **25 m** *or* **≥6** within **100 m** on primary corridors.  \n  - Many best‑visible spots are already held by incumbents; new entrant likely pushed to **inferior visibility or access**.\n\n- **Insufficient (0.0–2.9)**  \n  - Extreme crowding on the exact same paths **and** clear evidence the node is not absorbing it:  \n    - Very high counts on single corridors **plus** many weak/empty units.\n\n### 2.3 Saturation‑sensitive adjustment\n\n- If **Demand–Supply Balance ≤4.5** *and* there are **≥4 direct competitors within 100 m** on the same flows, Competitor Density score should normally be **≤4.0**.  \n- If **Demand–Supply Balance ≤3.0** *and* there are **≥6 direct competitors within 100 m** or **≥3 within 25 m**, Competitor Density score should normally be **≤3.0**.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Positioning Opportunity (white space & executable fit) – 20%\n\n**Goal:** Assess how much **monetizable differentiation room** exists on price, quality, speed, assortment, experience, and key dayparts – not just conceptual uniqueness.\n\n### 3.1 Checks\n\n- Are all major **price tiers** (value / mid / premium / luxury) already strongly served?  \n- Are key **formats** (express commuter, sit‑down third space, serious specialty, dessert‑driven, breakfast‑heavy) present on the same flows?  \n- Are critical **dayparts** (7–9 am, lunch, afternoon, evening) visibly underserved?  \n- Can the proposed concept plausibly become **best‑in‑class on ≥1 critical dimension** (e.g., fastest commuter option, clearly superior cup quality, only serious breakfast option)?  \n- Does the white space translate into **meaningful incremental volume** (e.g., realistic upside of **≥300–400 cups/day**, not just a small niche)?\n\n### 3.2 Scoring bands\n\n- **Excellent (9.0–10.0)**  \n  - Clear **and sizable** white spaces:  \n    - Missing or very weak representation at the **exact intended positioning**, such as:  \n      - High‑throughput, high‑quality commuter kiosk at a main exit where existing options are slow or sit‑down first; or  \n      - Strong breakfast/coffee combo where nearby cafes ignore breakfast.  \n  - Evidence that, if executed well, the concept could capture **≥400–600 incremental cups/day** beyond what generic competitors now serve.\n\n- **Good (7.0–8.9)**  \n  - Several **credible differentiation angles** even if similar formats exist:  \n    - Incumbents show visible pain points (long queues, slow service, weak breakfast, generic quality).  \n    - The new concept could realistically become a **top choice** for a defined niche (e.g., commuters who want better quality than value chains but faster than third spaces) with **≥300–400/day** upside.\n\n- **Adequate (5.0–6.9)**  \n  - Some white space, but **narrow or very execution‑dependent**:  \n    - Most price × format positions are already covered by strong brands;  \n    - Differentiation is mainly “**do the same thing a bit better**” without a structural gap;  \n    - Likely incremental volume **<300/day** unless execution is outstanding.\n\n- **Poor (3.0–4.9)**  \n  - Hard to stand out:  \n    - Each obvious niche (value commuter, mass specialty, premium sit‑down, design boutique, breakfast‑heavy) is occupied by strong incumbents with loyalty and good access;  \n    - New store risks being a **weaker or redundant copy**.  \n  - Realistic incremental upside likely **≤200–250/day**.\n\n- **Insufficient (0.0–2.9)**  \n  - No credible, monetizable positioning space:  \n    - All key **price × quality × speed × format × daypart** combinations are strongly covered;  \n    - Very little sign of unmet needs or friction;  \n    - Any difference is too minor to move volume.\n\n### 3.3 Volume‑linked cap\n\n- If **Demand–Supply Balance ≤4.0**, Positioning Opportunity score should normally be **≤6.0**, even if conceptually unique.  \n- If **Demand–Supply Balance ≤3.0**, Positioning Opportunity score should normally be **≤5.0**.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Incumbent Power & Reaction Risk – 15%\n\n**Goal:** Assess how dangerous nearby incumbents are in terms of brand strength, landlord relationships, digital ecosystems, and likely response.\n\n### 4.1 Checks\n\n- Number and proximity of **top‑tier brands** (Starbucks, Manner, Luckin, Cotti, M Stand, Peet’s, Tims, major bakery‑cafes) within **0–100 m**.  \n- Presence of any **flagship or halo units** (Reserve, roastery, iconic specialty bar) near the same flows.  \n- Evidence of **landlord alignment** (e.g., curated mix vs single‑brand dominance, exclusivity).  \n- Historical behavior: aggressive promo responses, corporate tie‑ups, etc.\n\n### 4.2 Scoring bands\n\n- **Excellent (9.0–10.0)**  \n  - Low competitive threat:  \n    - Nearby operators mostly **complementary** or in clearly different tiers/formats;  \n    - Few or no top‑tier chains within **50 m** on the same key paths;  \n    - Landlord appears open and balanced.\n\n- **Good (7.0–8.9)**  \n  - Some strong brands nearby but **only partial overlap**:  \n    - 1–2 major chains within **50–100 m**, but targeting different price tiers or dayparts;  \n    - No dominant flagship right next to the new store.\n\n- **Adequate (5.0–6.9)**  \n  - Clear competitive risk but manageable:  \n    - **2–3 strong chains** within **50–100 m** overlapping key dayparts;  \n    - No single hero unit perfectly matching the new store’s core use case.\n\n- **Poor (3.0–4.9)**  \n  - High risk from clustered, powerful incumbents:  \n    - **≥3 strong chains within 50 m**, or **≥5 within 100 m**, directly overlapping in price and primary use;  \n    - Landlord appears to favor current anchors, or incumbents are known to respond with deep promotions.\n\n- **Insufficient (0.0–2.9)**  \n  - Extremely high risk:  \n    - One or more **flagship/hero units** (Reserve, major specialty icon) within **≤25 m** and directly overlapping core use;  \n    - Or clear pattern of similar entrants failing quickly nearby.\n\n### 4.3 Scale‑sensitive guardrails\n\n- If a **flagship/hero unit** is within **≤25 m** and overlaps core use, this sub‑score should normally be **≤4.5**, **unless**:  \n  - Demand–Supply Balance **≥7.5** *and* Positioning Opportunity **≥7.5**.  \n- In dense clusters where there are **≥4 strong chains within 100 m** on the same flows, Incumbent Power score should typically be **≤5.5**.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Saturation Gates (caps on final score)\n\nAfter computing the weighted average of the four dimensions, apply these caps based on **Demand–Supply Balance** to avoid over‑scoring structurally over‑supplied nodes:\n\n- If **Demand–Supply Balance ≤2.9** (Failing / Over‑built):  \n  - **Cap final score at 3.5**, regardless of other dimensions.\n\n- If **Demand–Supply Balance 3.0–3.9** (Weak lower band):  \n  - **Cap final score at 4.5**.\n\n- If **Demand–Supply Balance 4.0–4.9** (Weak upper band):  \n  - **Cap final score at 5.5**.\n\n- If **Demand–Supply Balance ≥5.0**, no cap beyond the normal 0–10 range; other dimensions can raise or lower the final score as usual.\n\nThese gates ensure that locations with **very low realistic per‑store demand** cannot receive high overall scores purely because of big‑node footfall, theoretical positioning cleverness, or strong clustering effects.\n",

Demand–Supply & Contestable Volume – 40%\n\n**Goal:** Measure how much **realistic, contestable daily volume per outlet** is available, given traffic, number of outlets, and anchor lock‑in.\n\n### 1.1 Required inputs\n\n- **Relevant daily users** (within 500–800 m, or realistic catchment):\n  - Commuters (entries/exits at nearby stations, major bus nodes),\n  - Office workers who actually *pass near* the site, not just live in the district,\n  - Mall / shopping visitors on the same floors / corridors,\n  - Nearby residents (only a fraction as daily users).\n- **Category penetration** (coffee / high‑frequency beverages):\n  - Default: **5–10%** of relevant daily users in mature, urban nodes,\n  - **3–5%** in weaker coffee cultures.\n- **Total relevant outlets**: number of **directly comparable formats** within ≈500 m:\n  - Coffee / tea / high‑frequency beverage bars,\n  - Quick breakfast cafes where coffee is a main draw.\n\n### 1.2 Contestable volume calculation\n\n1. **Theoretical category volume** (per day)  \n   = relevant daily users × realistic penetration% (use band midpoint).\n\n2. **Theoretical per‑outlet volume**  \n   = theoretical category volume ÷ total relevant outlets.\n\n3. **Contestable share factor** – estimate how much of that category volume is **not structurally locked** by immediate anchors on the same main flows. Use observable evidence (queues, loyalty behavior, location).\n\n   - **High contestability (70–100%)**:\n     - No hero/flagship chain directly on the same main corridor within **≤25 m**, and\n     - Existing options show clear pain points (queues, slow, poor product, awkward detours), and\n     - Customers visibly multi‑home (switch brands) rather than stick to one anchor.\n\n   - **Moderate contestability (40–70%)**:\n     - 1–2 strong chains or a hero unit on/very near the same flows (**≤50 m**), **but**:\n       - They have significant pain points (price, queues, lack of speed/breakfast), *or*\n       - They sit slightly off the prime desire line so some traffic can be intercepted more conveniently.\n\n   - **Low contestability (10–40%)**:\n     - One or more **hero / flagship units** (e.g. Reserve, iconic specialty bar, dominant discount chain) directly on the main flows within **≤25–30 m**, and\n     - They are convenient, relatively efficient, and heavily used by the target segment (e.g. building tenants, commuters),\n     - Most users appear habit‑locked (queues but no visible spillover to weaker competitors).\n\n4. **Effective (contestable) per‑outlet volume**  \n   = theoretical per‑outlet volume × contestable share factor.\n\n### 1.3 Scoring bands (coffee / high‑frequency beverages)\n\nUse **effective per‑outlet volume** as the anchor. Adjust ±0.5–1.0 only with clear on‑site evidence (many closures vs all visibly busy).\n\n- **Excellent (9.0–10.0)**\n  - Effective per‑outlet volume **≥800/day**, or **≥650/day** with:\n    - Multiple incumbents showing **sustained queues** at key dayparts *without* extreme discounting, and\n    - Very few clearly weak or empty stores.\n\n- **Good (7.0–8.9)**\n  - Effective per‑outlet volume **550–799/day**, or **500–549/day** with strong evidence of healthy incumbents (busy peaks, no obvious dead units).\n  - A well‑executed entrant can likely reach **≥500/day**.\n\n- **Adequate (5.0–6.9)**\n  - Effective per‑outlet volume **380–549/day**.\n  - Mix of busy and average stores; some reliance on discounts, but not extreme.\n  - New entrant needs to **take share** or run efficiently; **~350–600/day** is plausible but not easy.\n\n- **Weak (3.0–4.9)**\n  - Effective per‑outlet volume **260–379/day** and at least one of:\n    - Several outlets clearly **under‑utilized** even in peaks,\n    - Frequent **deep discounting** across multiple chains,\n    - Recent closures / high churn of similar formats nearby.\n  - New entrant should expect hard share‑taking; sustainable volume **often ≤350/day**.\n\n- **Failing / Over‑built (0.0–2.9)**\n  - Effective per‑outlet volume **<260/day**, or clear structural over‑supply:\n    - Many outlets quiet or empty even at peaks,\n    - Repeated failures in similar formats on the same streets / floors,\n    - Permanent heavy discounting by multiple brands.\n\n### 1.4 Hub‑scale guardrails\n\n- If relevant daily users **≥200,000** *and* effective per‑outlet volume **≥550/day**, Demand–Supply score should **normally be ≥7.0**, unless on‑site evidence shows many weak units.\n- If effective per‑outlet volume **<380/day**, **do not uprate** just because the node is large or famous: score according to bands above.\n- If there is **low contestability (≤40%)** and a hero unit within **≤25 m**, Demand–Supply score should **not exceed 6.0**, even if theoretical per‑outlet volume is high.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Competitor Density & Micro‑Proximity – 20%\n\n**Goal:** Capture how **crowded the same flows** are, after adjusting for traffic. Focus on:\n- Direct substitutes within ≈300 m,\n- **Micro‑clusters** on the same corridors / concourses / street front,\n- Outlets **per 10,000 relevant daily users** near the site.\n\n### 2.1 Key measurements\n\n- Count **direct substitutes** (coffee / tea / quick breakfast cafés) within:\n  - **0–25 m** (same frontage / pod),\n  - **25–100 m** (same corridor / side of street),\n  - **100–300 m** (same node but secondary walk).\n- Compute **density per traffic** within ≈300 m:  \n  - direct outlets ÷ (relevant daily users / 10,000) = outlets per 10k users.\n\n### 2.2 Scoring bands\n\n- **Excellent (9.0–10.0)**\n  - Light or moderate density after scale adjustment:\n    - ≤**1.0** direct outlet per **10k** relevant daily users within ≈300 m, and\n    - No major direct competitor within **50 m** on the same primary path.\n\n- **Good (7.0–8.9)**\n  - Noticeable but manageable density:\n    - **1.0–2.0** direct outlets per 10k users within ≈300 m, and\n    - At most **1** direct substitute within **25 m**, and **≤3** within **100 m** on the same desire lines.\n\n- **Adequate (5.0–6.9)**\n  - High density typical of major hubs but still compatible with healthy demand:\n    - **2.0–3.0** direct outlets per 10k users within ≈300 m, or\n    - **3–5** direct substitutes within **100 m** on same corridors, **and** Demand–Supply score **≥6.5**.\n\n- **Poor (3.0–4.9)**\n  - Tight micro‑clustering on the same flows:\n    - **>3.0** direct outlets per 10k users within ≈300 m, or\n    - **≥3** direct substitutes within **25 m**, *or* **≥6** within **100 m** on primary corridors.\n  - New entrant likely pushed to **inferior visibility or access** positions.\n\n- **Insufficient (0.0–2.9)**\n  - Extreme crowding on the exact same paths **and** clear evidence the node is not absorbing supply:\n    - Very high counts on single corridors **plus** many weak/empty units.\n\n### 2.3 Saturation‑sensitive adjustment\n\n- If Demand–Supply score **≤4.5** *and* there are **≥4 direct competitors within 100 m** on the same flows, Competitor Density score should normally be **≤4.0**.\n- If Demand–Supply score **≤3.0** *and* there are **≥6 direct competitors within 100 m** or **≥3 within 25 m**, Competitor Density score should normally be **≤3.0**.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Positioning Opportunity (white space & executable fit) – 25%\n\n**Goal:** Assess how much **monetizable differentiation room** exists on price, quality, speed, assortment, experience, and key dayparts – and whether it can realistically convert into **substantial incremental volume** for this site.\n\n### 3.1 Checks\n\n- Are all major **price tiers** (value / mid / premium / luxury) already strongly served **on the same flows**?\n- Are key **formats** present nearby:\n  - Express commuter kiosks,\n  - Sit‑down third spaces,\n  - Serious specialty bars,\n  - Dessert‑driven or breakfast‑heavy concepts?\n- Are critical **dayparts** (7–9 am, lunch, afternoon, evening) visibly underserved on the paths the site can access **without detours**?\n- Can the proposed concept plausibly become **top‑2 choice** on ≥1 critical dimension (e.g. fastest commuter option, clearly best cup quality, only serious breakfast option) for a **clearly defined user group** that passes the site?\n- Does the white space translate into **meaningful incremental volume** (realistic upside of **≥300–400 cups/day**), not just a small niche?\n\n### 3.2 Scoring bands\n\n- **Excellent (9.0–10.0)**\n  - Clear and sizable white spaces on the **actual desire lines**:\n    - Missing or very weak representation at the intended positioning, such as:\n      - High‑throughput, high‑quality commuter kiosk at a main exit where existing offers are slow/sit‑down, or\n      - Strong breakfast+coffee where nearby cafes ignore breakfast, or\n      - Only serious specialty bar for a large, under‑served enthusiast group.\n  - If executed well, the concept could capture **≥400–600 incremental cups/day**.\n\n- **Good (7.0–8.9)**\n  - Several credible differentiation angles even if similar formats exist:\n    - Incumbents show visible pain points (long queues, slow service, weak breakfast, generic quality, awkward detours), and\n    - New concept can realistically become a **top choice** for a defined niche (e.g. commuters who want better quality than value chains but faster than third spaces) with **≥300–400/day** upside.\n\n- **Adequate (5.0–6.9)**\n  - Some white space, but **narrow or execution‑dependent**:\n    - Most price×format positions are covered by strong brands on similar flows,\n    - Differentiation is mainly 'do the same thing slightly better' without a structural gap in speed, access, or assortment,\n    - Likely incremental volume **200–300/day** unless execution is outstanding.\n\n- **Poor (3.0–4.9)**\n  - Hard to stand out in a saturated, well‑served cluster:\n    - Each obvious niche (value commuter, mass specialty, premium sit‑down, design boutique, breakfast‑heavy) is occupied by **2+ strong incumbents** with loyalty and good access on the same flows,\n    - New store risks being a weaker or redundant copy.\n  - Realistic incremental upside likely **≤200–250/day** even with good execution.\n\n- **Insufficient (0.0–2.9)**\n  - No credible, monetizable positioning space:\n    - All key **price × quality × speed × format × daypart** combinations are strongly covered **on the same corridors / concourses**,\n    - Very little sign of unmet needs or friction that could move real volume.\n\n### 3.3 Volume‑ and anchor‑linked caps\n\n- If Demand–Supply score **≤4.0**, Positioning Opportunity score should normally be **≤6.0**, even if conceptually unique.\n- If Demand–Supply score **≤3.0**, Positioning Opportunity score should normally be **≤5.0**.\n- If there are **≥2 hero / flagship units or top‑tier chains** (e.g. Reserve, iconic specialty, premium international brand) within **≤100 m** that already occupy the **same price × format × daypart** space, Positioning Opportunity score should normally be **≤4.5**.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Incumbent Power & Anchor Risk – 15%\n\n**Goal:** Assess how dangerous nearby incumbents are in terms of brand strength, anchor position on flows, landlord relationships, digital ecosystems, and likely response.\n\n### 4.1 Checks\n\n- Number and proximity of **top‑tier brands** (e.g. Starbucks, Starbucks Reserve, Manner, Luckin, Cotti, M Stand, Peet's, Tims, %Arabica, Blue Bottle, major bakery‑cafés) within **0–100 m**.\n- Presence of any **flagship / hero units** near the same flows:\n  - Reserve / roastery / iconic specialty bars,\n  - Luxury fashion‑attached cafés,\n  - Landmark high‑throughput kiosks at key exits.\n- Landlord behavior:\n  - Balanced multi‑brand mix vs strong preference for one chain,\n  - Existing exclusivity or portfolio strategies.\n- Competitive behavior:\n  - Aggressive promotions, corporate tie‑ups, app ecosystems, delivery dominance.\n\n### 4.2 Scoring bands\n\n- **Excellent (9.0–10.0)**\n  - Low competitive threat:\n    - Nearby operators mostly **complementary** or in clearly different tiers/uses,\n    - Few or no top‑tier chains within **50 m** on the same key paths,\n    - Landlord appears open and balanced.\n\n- **Good (7.0–8.9)**\n  - Some strong brands nearby but only **partial overlap**:\n    - **≤2** major chains within **50–100 m**, targeting different price tiers or primarily different dayparts,\n    - No dominant flagship directly adjacent to the new store.\n\n- **Adequate (5.0–6.9)**\n  - Clear competitive risk but manageable:\n    - **2–3 strong chains** within **50–100 m** overlapping key dayparts,\n    - No cluster of multiple hero units on the same frontage.\n\n- **Poor (3.0–4.9)**\n  - High risk from clustered, powerful incumbents:\n    - **≥3 strong chains within 50 m**, or **≥5 within 100 m**, directly overlapping primary use and price tier, or\n    - Landlord appears to favor current anchors; new entrant likely gets weaker positioning.\n\n- **Insufficient (0.0–2.9)**\n  - Extremely high anchor risk:\n    - **≥1 hero/flagship unit** within **≤25 m** directly overlapping the core use, *and* at least one additional top‑tier brand within **≤50 m**, or\n    - Clear pattern of similar entrants failing quickly in the immediate cluster.\n\n### 4.3 Scale‑ and anchor‑sensitive guardrails\n\n- If a **hero/flagship unit** is within **≤25 m** and overlaps core use, this sub‑score should normally be **≤4.5**, **unless**:\n  - Demand–Supply score **≥7.5** *and* Positioning Opportunity score **≥7.5**.\n- If there are **≥2 hero/flagship units or top‑tier chains** within **≤100 m** overlapping the new store's main positioning, Incumbent Power score should typically be **≤4.0**.\n- In dense clusters with **≥4 strong chains within 100 m** on the same flows, Incumbent Power score should be **≤5.5** in most cases.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Saturation & Risk Gates (caps on final score)\n\nAfter computing the weighted average of the four dimensions, apply these caps based on **Demand–Supply score** (using *effective* per‑outlet volume) and anchor risk. This prevents structurally over‑supplied, anchor‑locked nodes from scoring too high.\n\n- If Demand–Supply score **≤2.9** (Failing / Over‑built):\n  - **Cap final score at 3.5**, regardless of other dimensions.\n\n- If Demand–Supply score **3.0–3.9** (Weak lower band):\n  - **Cap final score at 4.5**.\n\n- If Demand–Supply score **4.0–4.4**:\n  - **Cap final score at 5.5**.\n\n- If Demand–Supply score **4.5–4.9** *and* there is a hero/flagship within **≤25 m**:\n  - **Cap final score at 5.5**.\n\n- If there are **≥2 hero/flagship units or top‑tier chains** within **≤100 m** overlapping the same price × format, and Positioning Opportunity score **≤4.5**:\n  - **Cap final score at 5.0**, even if Demand–Supply is higher.\n\n- If Demand–Supply score **≥5.0** and no special caps apply, final score can range freely **0–10** based on the weighted dimensions.\n\nThese gates ensure that locations with **low contestable per‑store demand** or **heavy anchor lock‑in** cannot receive high scores purely because of big‑node traffic or theoretical positioning cleverness.\n",

Node Scale and Realistic Store Volume – 50%\n\nGoal: Capture how much sustainable, contestable volume a well-executed new store can realistically do at this node, anchored in absolute daily cups rather than only per-outlet averages.\n\n1.1 Required inputs\n- Relevant daily users (within 500-800 m or realistic catchment):\n  - Commuters (entries/exits at nearby stations, major bus nodes)\n  - Office workers and students who actually pass near the site\n  - Mall and retail visitors on same floors and corridors\n  - Nearby residents (only the fraction likely to visit daily/weekly)\n- Category penetration (coffee or high-frequency beverages):\n  - Mature, urban coffee culture: 5-10% of relevant daily users\n  - Emerging or weaker coffee culture: 3-5%\n- Benchmark performance of comparable outlets in the node:\n  - Observed queues, turnover, closures, discount intensity\n  - Stated or inferred daily cups for key incumbents when available\n\n1.2 Estimating realistic sustainable volume for the new store\n- Step 1 – Theoretical category volume per day:\n  - Category volume = relevant daily users × realistic penetration% (use midpoint of range)\n- Step 2 – New store share estimate:\n  - Consider: adjacency and visibility, detour time vs nearest peers, brand power gap, format fit to main flows, price tier\n  - Use evidence from report to estimate realistic sustainable share, not best-case launch peak\n- Step 3 – Realistic sustainable daily cups for this store (RSV):\n  - RSV = theoretical category volume × realistic share estimate\n  - Cross-check with benchmarks: ensure RSV is plausible relative to busy peers and weaker units\n\n1.3 Scoring bands (based on RSV, coffee-focused formats)\n- Excellent (9.0-10.0)\n  - RSV ≥ 1,000 cups/day, or\n  - RSV 800-999/day in a node with relevant daily users ≥ 150,000 and multiple incumbents visibly busy across dayparts\n- Strong (7.0-8.9)\n  - RSV 600-999/day in most nodes, or\n  - RSV 500-599/day with clear evidence of healthy incumbents (sustained queues without extreme discounting) and robust coffee culture\n- Adequate (5.0-6.9)\n  - RSV 400-599/day, or\n  - RSV 350-399/day in a mid-scale node where the concept has strong fit and peers appear healthy\n- Weak (3.0-4.9)\n  - RSV 250-399/day, and at least one of:\n    - Several outlets under-utilized even at peaks\n    - Heavy reliance on deep discounts across multiple chains\n    - Recent closures or high churn in similar formats\n- Failing / Marginal (0.0-2.9)\n  - RSV < 250/day, or\n  - Clear structural oversupply with many quiet/empty units or repeated failures\n\n1.4 Guardrails for Node Scale and RSV\n- If relevant daily users ≥ 200,000 and RSV ≥ 800:\n  - Node Scale and RSV score should normally be ≥ 8.0\n- If relevant daily users ≥ 120,000 and RSV ≥ 600:\n  - Score should normally be ≥ 7.0\n- If relevant daily users ≤ 40,000 and RSV ≤ 300:\n  - Score should normally be ≤ 6.0\n- Do not uprate weak RSV just because the node is famous or large on paper; use RSV bands as primary anchor.\n\n---\n\n2. Competitor Density and Micro-Proximity – 20%\n\nGoal: Measure how crowded the same flows are by direct substitutes, adjusted for node scale and RSV, and whether the entrant is likely to be pushed into inferior micro-positions.\n\n2.1 Key measurements\n- Count direct substitutes within three rings (same corridor or side of street when applicable):\n  - 0-25 m: same frontage, cluster, or immediate pod\n  - 25-100 m: same corridor or same side of main street\n  - 100-300 m: same node but secondary walk\n- Density per traffic within about 300 m:\n  - Direct outlets per 10,000 relevant daily users\n- Micro-positioning:\n  - Whether the new store can sit on a primary desire line or is forced into side corridors\n\n2.2 Scoring bands (adjusting for Node Scale and RSV)\n- Excellent (9.0-10.0)\n  - ≤ 1.0 direct outlet per 10k relevant daily users within 300 m, and\n  - No major direct competitor within 50 m on the same primary path\n- Good (7.0-8.9)\n  - 1.0-2.0 direct outlets per 10k users within 300 m, and\n  - At most 1 direct competitor within 25 m, and ≤ 3 within 100 m on same desire lines\n- Adequate (5.0-6.9)\n  - 2.0-3.0 direct outlets per 10k users within 300 m, or\n  - 3-5 direct substitutes within 100 m on same corridors, and Node Scale and RSV score ≥ 7.0\n- Poor (3.0-4.9)\n  - > 3.0 direct outlets per 10k users within 300 m, or\n  - ≥ 3 direct substitutes within 25 m, or ≥ 6 within 100 m on primary corridors\n- Insufficient (0.0-2.9)\n  - Extreme crowding plus visible signs the node is not absorbing supply (many weak/empty units, closures)\n\n2.3 Scale-sensitive adjustments\n- If Node Scale and RSV score ≥ 8.0 (RSV ≥ 800) and most nearby units are busy:\n  - Competitor Density score should normally not be < 5.0, even if micro-clustered\n- If Node Scale and RSV score ≤ 4.0 and there are ≥ 4 direct competitors within 100 m on same flows:\n  - Competitor Density score should normally be ≤ 4.0\n\n---\n\n3. Positioning Opportunity (white space and executable fit) – 20%\n\nGoal: Assess whether the new concept has clear, monetizable differentiation on price, quality, speed, assortment, format, or daypart that can reasonably translate into additional daily cups, not just minor preference shifts.\n\n3.1 Checks\n- Coverage of price tiers on same flows:\n  - Value, mid, premium, luxury\n- Presence of key formats nearby:\n  - Fast commuter kiosks\n  - Sit-down third spaces\n  - Specialty/enthusiast bars\n  - Dessert- or breakfast-heavy concepts\n- Daypart coverage:\n  - 7-9 am, lunch, afternoon, evening on the actual desire lines the new store can access with ≤ 2-3 minutes detour\n- Can the new store plausibly be top-2 choice for at least one sizeable segment (e.g. fastest high-quality commuter option, only serious breakfast+coffee, best specialty quality) that passes the site?\n- Estimate incremental volume from differentiation (not total RSV):\n  - Can white space plausibly add ≥ 200-300 cups/day vs being just another similar option?\n\n3.2 Scoring bands\n- Excellent (9.0-10.0)\n  - Clear structural white spaces on the actual flows, such as:\n    - High-throughput, high-quality commuter kiosk where incumbents are slow/sit-down\n    - Strong breakfast+coffee where existing cafes ignore breakfast\n    - Only serious specialty bar for a large, under-served enthusiast cluster\n  - If executed well, incremental uplift ≥ 500 cups/day and RSV band is raised (e.g. from 600 to 1,000)\n- Good (7.0-8.9)\n  - Several credible differentiation angles even if similar formats exist:\n    - Visible pain points in incumbents (queues, slow service, weak breakfast, generic quality, awkward detours)\n    - New concept can be top choice for a defined niche with incremental potential ≈ 300-500 cups/day\n- Adequate (5.0-6.9)\n  - Some white space but narrow or heavily execution-dependent:\n    - Most price-format positions covered by strong brands on similar flows\n    - Differentiation mainly doing the same but slightly better in quality or service\n    - Incremental potential ≈ 200-300 cups/day in most scenarios\n- Poor (3.0-4.9)\n  - Hard to stand out in a saturated, well-served cluster:\n    - Each obvious niche (value commuter, mass specialty, premium sit-down, design boutique, breakfast-heavy) has 2+ strong incumbents on same flows\n    - New store at risk of being redundant\n  - Incremental potential likely ≤ 200-250 cups/day\n- Insufficient (0.0-2.9)\n  - No credible, monetizable positioning space:\n    - All key price × quality × speed × format × daypart positions strongly covered nearby\n    - Little sign of friction that could move real volume\n\n3.3 Volume-linked caps\n- If Node Scale and RSV score ≤ 4.0 (RSV ≤ 399):\n  - Positioning Opportunity score should normally be ≤ 6.0\n- If Node Scale and RSV score ≤ 3.0 (RSV < 300):\n  - Positioning Opportunity score should normally be ≤ 5.0\n\n---\n\n4. Incumbent Power and Anchor Risk – 10%\n\nGoal: Assess how dangerous nearby incumbents are in terms of brand strength, anchor positioning, digital ecosystems, and likely aggressive response, while recognising that strong peers in very large nodes do not automatically make the node unattractive.\n\n4.1 Checks\n- Presence and proximity of top-tier brands within 0-100 m (same flows):\n  - Examples: Starbucks, Starbucks Reserve, Manner, Luckin, Cotti, M Stand, %Arabica, Blue Bottle, Peet's, major bakery-cafe anchors\n- Hero or flagship units:\n  - Reserve/roastery\n  - Iconic specialty bars\n  - Landmark kiosks at main exits\n- Landlord behaviour:\n  - Exclusive relationships vs open multi-brand\n- Competitive behaviour:\n  - Heavy promotions, corporate tie-ups, strong app ecosystems, delivery dominance\n\n4.2 Scoring bands\n- Excellent (9.0-10.0)\n  - Low competitive threat:\n    - Nearby operators mostly complementary or in clearly different tiers/uses\n    - Few or no top-tier chains within 50 m on same key paths\n- Good (7.0-8.9)\n  - Some strong brands nearby but only partial overlap:\n    - ≤ 2 major chains within 50-100 m targeting different price tiers or mainly different dayparts\n- Adequate (5.0-6.9)\n  - Clear competitive risk but manageable:\n    - 2-3 strong chains within 50-100 m overlapping key use cases\n    - No cluster of multiple hero units on exact same frontage\n- Poor (3.0-4.9)\n  - High anchor risk:\n    - ≥ 3 strong chains within 50 m, or ≥ 5 within 100 m directly overlapping primary use and price tier, or\n    - Landlord appears to favour existing anchors\n- Insufficient (0.0-2.9)\n  - Extremely high anchor risk:\n    - ≥ 1 hero/flagship unit within ≤ 25 m directly overlapping core use, and at least one additional top-tier brand within ≤ 50 m, or\n    - Clear pattern of similar entrants failing quickly in the immediate cluster\n\n4.3 Scale-sensitive guardrails\n- If Node Scale and RSV score ≥ 8.0 (RSV ≥ 800):\n  - Incumbent Power score should normally not be < 4.0, even with strong anchors present, unless there is clear evidence of repeated failures for similar entrants on the same corridor\n- If there are ≥ 2 hero or flagship units within 100 m overlapping the same price × format, and Node Scale and RSV score ≤ 6.0:\n  - Incumbent Power score should typically be ≤ 4.0\n\n---\n\n5. Saturation and Risk Gates (caps on final score)\n\nApply after computing the weighted average.\n\n5.1 RSV-based caps\n- If Node Scale and RSV score ≤ 2.9 (RSV < 250):\n  - Cap final score at 4.0\n- If Node Scale and RSV score 3.0-3.9 (RSV 250-299):\n  - Cap final score at 5.0\n- If Node Scale and RSV score 4.0-4.4 (RSV 300-349):\n  - Cap final score at 6.0\n\n5.2 Anchor override caps\n- If there is a hero/flagship unit within ≤ 25 m directly overlapping core use and Incumbent Power score ≤ 4.0:\n  - Cap final score at 7.0\n\n5.3 Protection for very strong nodes\n- If Node Scale and RSV score ≥ 8.0 and Competitor Density score ≥ 5.0:\n  - Do not cap final score below 7.0 solely due to anchor presence\n\n---\n\n6. Cross-location consistency and minimum spreads\n\nGoal: Ensure that locations with very different realistic volume potential do not end up with almost identical scores.\n\n6.1 Volume band consistency when comparing multiple locations in the same city or project\n- Define RSV bands:\n  - Band A: RSV < 250\n  - Band B: 250-399\n  - Band C: 400-599\n  - Band D: 600-899\n  - Band E: ≥ 900\n- When ranking or comparing nodes:\n  - If two locations fall into bands that are two or more steps apart (e.g. Band B vs Band D, or Band C vs Band E):\n    - Their final scores should normally differ by at least 2.0 points\n  - If two locations fall into adjacent bands (e.g. Band C vs Band D):\n    - Their final scores should normally differ by at least 1.0 point\n- Avoid assigning identical or near-identical scores (difference < 0.5) to locations in different RSV bands unless there is a compelling, documented qualitative reason (e.g. extreme anchor lock-in at the higher-RSV node).",

Positioning White Space – 15%\n\n3.1 Checks\n- Coverage by incumbent formats on same main flows (0–100 m):\n  - Value chains (Luckin/Cotti-style), mass specialty (Manner-style), global brands (Starbucks/Costa/Tims), premium boutiques, brunch/bakery sit-down.\n- Daypart coverage by these incumbents:\n  - 7–9 am commuter, lunch, afternoon, evening.\n- Potential roles for new store on these flows:\n  - Fastest high-quality commuter option on the main path (≤60–90 seconds per drink; clearly faster than nearby peers).\n  - Distinctive product or roast profile appealing to quality-sensitive regulars (not just another generic latte bar).\n  - Only or clearly best option for a specific sizeable niche (e.g. serious breakfast+coffee on that corridor).\n- Estimate incremental uplift from differentiation:\n  - How many additional cups/day vs being a generic follower can white space reasonably add (not total RSV)?\n\n3.2 Scoring bands\n- Excellent (9.0–10.0)\n  - Clear, structural white space on the main flows, such as:\n    - No truly fast commuter-focused specialty outlet within 50 m in a heavy office stream; or\n    - No serious specialty-quality player while large quality-seeking base is evident.\n  - If executed well, differentiation could plausibly add ≥ 500 cups/day vs a generic offer.\n- Good (7.0–8.9)\n  - 1–2 strong differentiation angles even though similar brands exist, with visible pain points (queues, slow service, weak breakfast, tourist-only focus).\n  - Incremental potential ≈ 300–500 cups/day.\n- Adequate (5.0–6.9)\n  - Some white space but narrow or very execution-dependent.\n  - Most price/format positions are covered; new store is mainly a better-executed variant.\n  - Incremental potential ≈ 200–300 cups/day.\n- Poor (3.0–4.9)\n  - All major positions (value commuter, mass specialty, premium sit-down, design boutique, breakfast+coffee) are already held by 2+ strong players on the same flows.\n  - Incremental potential likely ≤ 150–200 cups/day.\n- Insufficient (0.0–2.9)\n  - No credible, monetizable white space; new store is effectively redundant.\n\n3.3 Volume-linked caps\n- If Effective Node Volume (RSV) score ≤ 4.0 (RSV ≤ 399):\n  - Positioning White Space score should normally be ≤ 6.0.\n- If Effective Node Volume (RSV) score ≤ 3.0 (RSV < 300):\n  - Positioning White Space score should normally be ≤ 5.0.\n\n---\n4. Anchor / Incumbent Risk – 10%\n\n4.1 Inputs\n- Presence and proximity (0–100 m) of top-tier brands on same flows:\n  - Starbucks (especially Reserve/flagship), Manner, Luckin, Cotti, M Stand, Peet's, %Arabica, Blue Bottle, major bakery-cafe anchors.\n- Hero or flagship units:\n  - Reserve/roastery, iconic specialty bars, landmark kiosks at main exits, heavily marketed themed stores.\n- Depth of clustering of strong brands around the site.\n- Competitive behaviour:\n  - Aggressive promotions, app ecosystems, delivery dominance, corporate tie-ups.\n\n4.2 Scoring bands\n- Excellent (9.0–10.0)\n  - No top-tier chains within 50 m on main flows; and\n  - At most 1–2 within 100 m, with clearly different price tiers or dayparts.\n- Good (7.0–8.9)\n  - 1–2 strong chains within 50 m with partial overlap; or\n  - 3–4 within 100 m but with mixed formats (e.g. more sit-down, more tourist focus) and strong node volume.\n- Adequate (5.0–6.9)\n  - 2–3 strong chains within 50 m, overlapping some core use cases; or\n  - 5–6 within 100 m, but no single hero flagship directly on top of the site.\n- Poor (3.0–4.9)\n  - ≥ 1 hero/flagship unit (e.g. Reserve, iconic flagship) within 25 m directly overlapping target use; and/or\n  - ≥ 4 strong chains within 50 m or ≥ 7 within 100 m on same flows.\n- Insufficient (0.0–2.9)\n  - Hero/flagship unit sharing almost the same node (0–10 m) plus multiple strong chains (≥ 3) within 50 m; or\n  - Clear pattern of similar entrants failing on the same frontage.\n\n4.3 Scale-sensitive notes\n- In extremely large nodes with very high effective RSV (≥ 900), Incumbent Risk may be somewhat mitigated but not ignored; do not raise this dimension above 6.0 if a flagship competitor is essentially co-located.\n\n---\n5. Gates and Cross-node Consistency\n\n5.1 RSV-based caps on final score\n- If Effective Node Volume score ≤ 2.9 (RSV < 250):\n  - Cap final score at 4.0.\n- If Effective Node Volume score 3.0–3.9 (RSV 250–299):\n  - Cap final score at 5.0.\n- If Effective Node Volume score 4.0–4.4 (RSV 300–349):\n  - Cap final score at 6.0.\n\n5.2 Extreme anchor override caps\n- If there is a hero/flagship unit within 0–10 m directly overlapping the new store's core use; and\n  - There are ≥ 3 other strong chains within 50 m, or ≥ 6 within 100 m on the same flows:\n    - Cap final score at 6.0.\n- If there is a hero/flagship within 0–25 m and Saturation & Competitor Density score ≤ 4.0:\n  - Cap final score at 6.5.\n\n5.3 Protection for very strong, less-saturated nodes\n- If Effective Node Volume score ≥ 8.0 and Saturation & Competitor Density score ≥ 5.0:\n  - Do not cap final score below 7.0 solely due to anchor presence.\n\n5.4 Minimum spreads between locations (same city / project)\n- Define RSV bands by daily cups for the new store:\n  - Band A: < 250\n  - Band B: 250–399\n  - Band C: 400–549\n  - Band D: 550–799\n  - Band E: ≥ 800\n- When comparing two locations:\n  - If they fall two or more bands apart (e.g. B vs D, C vs E):\n    - Their final scores should differ by at least 2.0 points in the same direction as RSV.\n  - If they fall in adjacent bands (e.g. C vs D):\n    - Their final scores should differ by at least 1.0 point in the same direction as RSV.\n  - If RSV estimates differ by ≥ 30% (ratio ≥ 1.3 or ≤ 0.77) and bands differ, avoid giving scores whose ratio contradicts the RSV ratio.\n\n---\n6. Application notes (for report writers)\n- Always base Effective Node Volume on people passing within 0–50 m of the proposed frontage in key dayparts, not on entire-station or district traffic.\n- In extremely saturated CBD / tourist clusters with 40–70 coffee-related outlets in 500 m and multiple flagships, default to low new-store share unless there is compelling, quantified evidence to support higher RSV.\n- In dense office clusters with high effective passers and fewer total outlets, allow RSV and final scores to be higher even if per-worker coffee density is already above average.",

Positioning White Space – 10%\n\n3.1 Checks\n- **Coverage by incumbent formats on same main flows (0–100 m)**\n  - Value commuter chains (Luckin/Cotti-style).\n  - Mass specialty (Manner-style).\n  - Global brands (Starbucks/Costa/Tims).\n  - Premium boutiques / design cafés.\n  - Brunch/bakery sit-down with strong coffee.\n- **Daypart coverage** by incumbents (7–9 am commute, lunch, afternoon, evening).\n- **Potential roles for new store on same flows**\n  - Fastest high-quality commuter option (order-to-drink ≤ 60–90 sec) with clear proof of speed vs peers.\n  - Distinctive product / roast / flavor profile that is clearly different from nearby chains.\n  - Only or clearly best option for a specific sizeable niche (e.g., serious coffee + grab-and-go breakfast on that corridor).\n- Estimate **incremental uplift** from differentiation vs being a generic follower (cups/day).\n\n3.2 Scoring bands\n- **Excellent (9.0–10.0)**\n  - Clear structural white space on main flows (0–50 m), e.g.:\n    - No truly fast commuter-focused specialty outlet; or\n    - No serious specialty-quality player despite obvious quality-seeking base.\n  - Plausible incremental uplift from differentiation **≥ 400–500 cups/day** vs a generic offer.\n- **Good (7.0–8.9)**\n  - 1–2 strong, monetizable differentiation angles despite similar brands; visible pain points (queues, slow service, weak breakfast, tourist-only focus).\n  - Incremental potential ≈ **250–400 cups/day**.\n- **Adequate (5.0–6.9)**\n  - Some white space but narrow or execution-dependent; most price/format slots are already covered.\n  - Incremental potential ≈ **150–250 cups/day**.\n- **Poor (3.0–4.9)**\n  - All major positions (value commuter, mass specialty, premium sit-down, design boutique, breakfast+coffee) already held by 2+ strong players on same flows.\n  - Incremental potential likely **≤ 150 cups/day**.\n- **Insufficient (0.0–2.9)**\n  - No credible, monetizable white space; new store is effectively redundant on the corridor.\n\n3.3 Volume-linked caps\n- If Effective Node Volume score **≤ 4.0** (RSV < 350):\n  - Positioning White Space score should normally be **≤ 6.0**.\n- If Effective Node Volume score **≤ 3.0** (RSV < 250):\n  - Positioning White Space score should normally be **≤ 5.0**.\n\n---\n4. Anchor / Incumbent Risk – 10%\n\n4.1 Inputs\n- Presence and proximity (0–100 m) of **top-tier brands on same flows**:\n  - Starbucks (especially Reserve/flagship), Manner, Luckin, Cotti, M Stand, Peet's, %Arabica, Blue Bottle, major bakery-café anchors.\n- **Hero or flagship units**:\n  - Reserve/Roastery, iconic specialty bars, landmark kiosks directly on main exits.\n- **Depth of clustering** of strong brands around the site (how many within 0–50 m and 50–100 m on main paths).\n- **Competitive behaviour**:\n  - Aggressive digital promotions, large app ecosystems, delivery dominance, corporate tie-ups.\n\n4.2 Scoring bands\n- **Excellent (9.0–10.0)**\n  - No top-tier chains within 50 m on main flows; and\n  - At most 1–2 within 100 m, with clearly different price tiers or primary dayparts.\n- **Good (7.0–8.9)**\n  - 1–2 strong chains within 50 m with only partial overlap; or\n  - 3–4 within 100 m but mixed formats (e.g., more sit-down, more tourist focus) and strong node volume.\n- **Adequate (5.0–6.9)**\n  - 2–3 strong chains within 50 m, overlapping some core use cases; or\n  - 5–6 within 100 m, but no single hero flagship directly on top of the site.\n- **Poor (3.0–4.9)**\n  - ≥ 1 hero/flagship unit (e.g., Reserve, iconic flagship) within 25 m **directly overlapping** target use; and/or\n  - ≥ 4 strong chains within 50 m or ≥ 7 within 100 m on same flows.\n- **Extreme (0.0–2.9)**\n  - Hero/flagship unit essentially co-located (0–10 m) plus multiple strong chains (≥ 3) within 50 m on same flow; or\n  - Clear pattern of similar entrants failing recently on the same frontage.\n\n4.3 Scale-sensitive notes\n- In **extremely large nodes** with very high RSV (≥ 900), strong anchors still matter but should not fully override volume:\n  - Do not raise this dimension above **6.0** if a hero/flagship is co-located on the same flow.\n\n---\n5. Gates and Cross-node Consistency\n\n5.1 RSV-based caps on final score\n- If Effective Node Volume score **≤ 2.9** (RSV < 250):\n  - Cap final score at **4.5**.\n- If Effective Node Volume score **3.0–3.9** (RSV 250–299):\n  - Cap final score at **5.5**.\n- If Effective Node Volume score **4.0–4.4** (RSV 300–349):\n  - Cap final score at **6.5**.\n\n5.2 Extreme anchor override caps\n- If there is a **hero/flagship unit within 0–10 m** directly overlapping the new store's core use; and\n  - There are **≥ 3 other strong chains within 50 m**, or **≥ 6 within 100 m** on the same flows:\n    - Cap final score at **6.5**.\n- If there is a hero/flagship within 0–25 m and Saturation & Per-capita Competition score **≤ 4.0**:\n  - Cap final score at **7.0**.\n\n5.3 Protection for very strong, less-saturated nodes\n- If Effective Node Volume score **≥ 8.0** and Saturation & Per-capita Competition score **≥ 5.0**:\n  - Do not cap final score below **7.0** solely due to anchor presence.\n\n5.4 Cross-node spread rules (same city / same decision set)\n- Define RSV bands by daily cups:\n  - Band A: < 250\n  - Band B: 250–349\n  - Band C: 350–449\n  - Band D: 450–599\n  - Band E: 600–799\n  - Band F: ≥ 800\n- When comparing two locations:\n  - If they fall **two or more bands apart** (e.g., B vs D, C vs E):\n    - Their final scores should differ by **≥ 2.0 points** in the direction of the higher RSV.\n  - If they fall in **adjacent bands** (e.g., C vs D):\n    - Their final scores should differ by **≥ 1.0 point** in the direction of the higher RSV.\n  - If RSV ratio **≥ 2.0 or ≤ 0.5**:\n    - Avoid giving final scores whose **ratio is < 1.3** in the opposite direction or nearly flat.\n\n5.5 Application notes (for report writers)\n- Always base Effective Node Volume on **0–50 m flows by daypart**, not entire-station or district traffic.\n- Treat **time-based catchments (e.g., 5–10 min walk)** only as support for understanding where users come from, not as direct substitutes for 0–50 m passers.\n- In highly saturated CBD / flagship clusters with 40–70 coffee-related outlets in 500 m, default to **low new-store share** unless there is quantified evidence for higher share – but still respect very high effective traffic.\n- In dense office clusters with high effective passers and fewer outlets per user, allow RSV and final scores to be **meaningfully higher** than in mid-volume suburban malls with similar raw outlet counts.",
