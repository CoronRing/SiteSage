Competition & Node Potential Rubric

Goal
- Score 0–10 on **net competitive favorability** for a new coffee-focused store at a given node.
- Score should track **realistic sustainable daily cups (RSV)** for this store.
- Higher-RSV nodes must score **clearly higher**, and large differences in effective traffic should translate to **meaningful score gaps**.

Dimension weights (sum = 100%)
1. Effective Node Volume (RSV proxy) – **65%**
2. Saturation & Per-capita Competition – **15%**
3. Positioning White Space – **10%**
4. Anchor / Incumbent Risk – **10%**

Final score = weighted average of 4 dimensions, then adjusted by gates in Section 5.

1. Effective Node Volume (RSV proxy) – 65%

1.1 Required inputs
- **Effective passers (by daypart, within 0–50 m of frontage)**
  - Morning peak (7:30–10:30) – only people passing within ~0–50 m on real desire lines.
  - Other dayparts (lunch, afternoon, evening) – only if flows pass within ~0–50 m.
- **Daily-path base (0–100 m)**
  - Office workers, students, mall staff whose **daily path** passes within 0–100 m.
  - Residents within 800–1,000 m who are likely **weekly visitors** to this node.
- **Coffee penetration assumptions (daily buyers among relevant users)**
  - Mature CBD / dense office cluster: **8–10%**.
  - Strong mixed-use mall + offices: **6–8%**.
  - Community / weaker coffee culture: **3–6%**.
- **New-store share assumptions (of total coffee volume at node)**
  - Heavy saturation, many strong brands on same corridor: **3–6%**.
  - Moderate competition, good micro-position: **6–10%**.
  - Light competition, strong micro-position: **10–15%**.
  - Adjust down if micro-position off main line or detour >3 min vs peers.

1.2 Estimating RSV (step-by-step)
- Step 1 – **Effective daily users**
  - Start from morning 0–50 m flows; add other dayparts that also pass 0–50 m (use conservative estimates, avoid counting whole-station entries).
- Step 2 – **Theoretical coffee volume**
  - Theoretical cups/day = effective users × appropriate penetration % (use mid-point of range).
- Step 3 – **New-store share**
  - Choose share band based on competition and micro-position.
  - Reduce share if multiple similar brands sit directly on same 0–50 m path.
- Step 4 – **RSV (realistic sustainable cups/day)**
  - RSV = theoretical cups/day × new-store share.
  - Cross-check vs observed benchmarks for similar brands at the node.

1.3 Scoring bands (by RSV)
- **Excellent (9.0–10.0)**
  - RSV ≥ 1,000 cups/day.
- **Very strong (8.0–8.9)**
  - RSV 800–999 cups/day.
- **Strong (7.0–7.9)**
  - RSV 600–799 cups/day.
- **Upper-adequate (6.0–6.9)**
  - RSV 450–599 cups/day.
- **Adequate (5.0–5.9)**
  - RSV 350–449 cups/day.
- **Weak (4.0–4.9)**
  - RSV 250–349 cups/day.
- **Failing / Marginal (0.0–3.9)**
  - RSV < 250 cups/day.

1.4 Guardrails & sensitivity
- If **effective morning peak passers within 0–50 m ≥ 12,000** and per-capita competition (see 2.2) is not extreme (>4 outlets per 10k users):
  - Effective Node Volume score should normally be **≥ 7.5** even if competition is dense.
- If effective morning peak passers within 0–50 m are **6,000–11,999** and RSV **450–699**:
  - Score should normally be **≥ 6.5**.
- If effective morning peak passers within 0–50 m **≤ 4,000** and RSV **≤ 350**:
  - Score should normally be **≤ 6.0**.
- **Cross-location sensitivity (same city / decision set):**
  - If two locations’ estimated RSV differ by a factor **≥ 2.0**, their Effective Node Volume scores must differ by **≥ 2.0 points** in the same direction.
  - If RSV ratio is **1.5–2.0**, their Effective Node Volume scores must differ by **≥ 1.0 point** in the same direction.

2. Saturation & Per-capita Competition – 15%

2.1 Inputs
- Count **direct substitutes** (coffee-first; plus bakeries/tea that realistically capture morning coffee) in rings:
  - 0–25 m – same frontage / same immediate cluster.
  - 25–100 m – same corridor or side of main street.
  - 100–300 m – same node, short walk.
- Within 300 m, estimate **effective daily users** who can reach with ≤3 min detour (from Section 1 inputs).
- Compute **per-capita density**:
  - Direct coffee outlets (including coffee-strong bakeries) **per 10,000 effective daily users**.
- Note **qualitative saturation signals**:
  - Many quiet or visibly weak units.
  - Heavy, persistent discounting.
  - Recent closures on same corridor.

2.2 Scoring bands (combine absolute counts + per-capita)
- **Excellent (9.0–10.0)**
  - ≤ 3 direct coffee outlets within 100 m; and
  - ≤ 10 direct coffee outlets within 300 m; and
  - ≤ 1.5 direct outlets per 10k effective daily users; and
  - Few/no weak or empty units.
- **Good (7.0–8.9)**
  - 4–6 direct outlets within 100 m; or
  - 11–18 within 300 m; and
  - 1.6–2.5 outlets per 10k effective users; and
  - Most units healthy, no clear oversupply.
- **Adequate (5.0–6.9)**
  - 7–9 direct outlets within 100 m; or
  - 19–30 within 300 m; or
  - 2.6–3.5 outlets per 10k effective users;
  - Node still has strong Effective Node Volume (score ≥ 6.5) and most peers appear healthy.
- **Poor (3.0–4.9)**
  - ≥ 10 direct outlets within 100 m; or
  - 31–45 within 300 m; or
  - > 3.5 outlets per 10k effective users; or
  - Clear signs that additional similar stores mostly cannibalise share (weak units despite good traffic).
- **Extreme saturation (0.0–2.9)**
  - > 50 coffee-related outlets within 500 m; and
  - Multiple visibly weak or half-empty coffee units on same main flows; and
  - Per-capita density clearly above sustainable norms (> 4.5 direct outlets per 10k effective users).

2.3 Scale-sensitive notes
- In **very high-volume CBD nodes** with many outlets but still healthy peers, do **not** automatically push this score into 0–2 range; use **3–5** unless there is evidence of structural oversupply.
- In **medium-volume suburban/commercial nodes** with much lower effective passers, similar outlet counts should be penalized **more harshly** via per-capita density.

3. Positioning White Space – 10%

3.1 Checks
- **Coverage by incumbent formats on same main flows (0–100 m)**
  - Value commuter chains (Luckin/Cotti-style).
  - Mass specialty (Manner-style).
  - Global brands (Starbucks/Costa/Tims).
  - Premium boutiques / design cafés.
  - Brunch/bakery sit-down with strong coffee.
- **Daypart coverage** by incumbents (7–9 am commute, lunch, afternoon, evening).
- **Potential roles for new store on same flows**
  - Fastest high-quality commuter option (order-to-drink ≤ 60–90 sec) with clear proof of speed vs peers.
  - Distinctive product / roast / flavor profile that is clearly different from nearby chains.
  - Only or clearly best option for a specific sizeable niche (e.g., serious coffee + grab-and-go breakfast on that corridor).
- Estimate **incremental uplift** from differentiation vs being a generic follower (cups/day).

3.2 Scoring bands
- **Excellent (9.0–10.0)**
  - Clear structural white space on main flows (0–50 m), e.g.:
    - No truly fast commuter-focused specialty outlet; or
    - No serious specialty-quality player despite obvious quality-seeking base.
  - Plausible incremental uplift from differentiation **≥ 400–500 cups/day** vs a generic offer.
- **Good (7.0–8.9)**
  - 1–2 strong, monetizable differentiation angles despite similar brands; visible pain points (queues, slow service, weak breakfast, tourist-only focus).
  - Incremental potential ≈ **250–400 cups/day**.
- **Adequate (5.0–6.9)**
  - Some white space but narrow or execution-dependent; most price/format slots are already covered.
  - Incremental potential ≈ **150–250 cups/day**.
- **Poor (3.0–4.9)**
  - All major positions (value commuter, mass specialty, premium sit-down, design boutique, breakfast+coffee) already held by 2+ strong players on same flows.
  - Incremental potential likely **≤ 150 cups/day**.
- **Insufficient (0.0–2.9)**
  - No credible, monetizable white space; new store is effectively redundant on the corridor.

3.3 Volume-linked caps
- If Effective Node Volume score **≤ 4.0** (RSV < 350):
  - Positioning White Space score should normally be **≤ 6.0**.
- If Effective Node Volume score **≤ 3.0** (RSV < 250):
  - Positioning White Space score should normally be **≤ 5.0**.

4. Anchor / Incumbent Risk – 10%

4.1 Inputs
- Presence and proximity (0–100 m) of **top-tier brands on same flows**:
  - Starbucks (especially Reserve/flagship), Manner, Luckin, Cotti, M Stand, Peet's, %Arabica, Blue Bottle, major bakery-café anchors.
- **Hero or flagship units**:
  - Reserve/Roastery, iconic specialty bars, landmark kiosks directly on main exits.
- **Depth of clustering** of strong brands around the site (how many within 0–50 m and 50–100 m on main paths).
- **Competitive behaviour**:
  - Aggressive digital promotions, large app ecosystems, delivery dominance, corporate tie-ups.

4.2 Scoring bands
- **Excellent (9.0–10.0)**
  - No top-tier chains within 50 m on main flows; and
  - At most 1–2 within 100 m, with clearly different price tiers or primary dayparts.
- **Good (7.0–8.9)**
  - 1–2 strong chains within 50 m with only partial overlap; or
  - 3–4 within 100 m but mixed formats (e.g., more sit-down, more tourist focus) and strong node volume.
- **Adequate (5.0–6.9)**
  - 2–3 strong chains within 50 m, overlapping some core use cases; or
  - 5–6 within 100 m, but no single hero flagship directly on top of the site.
- **Poor (3.0–4.9)**
  - ≥ 1 hero/flagship unit (e.g., Reserve, iconic flagship) within 25 m **directly overlapping** target use; and/or
  - ≥ 4 strong chains within 50 m or ≥ 7 within 100 m on same flows.
- **Extreme (0.0–2.9)**
  - Hero/flagship unit essentially co-located (0–10 m) plus multiple strong chains (≥ 3) within 50 m on same flow; or
  - Clear pattern of similar entrants failing recently on the same frontage.

4.3 Scale-sensitive notes
- In **extremely large nodes** with very high RSV (≥ 900), strong anchors still matter but should not fully override volume:
  - Do not raise this dimension above **6.0** if a hero/flagship is co-located on the same flow.

5. Gates and Cross-node Consistency

5.1 RSV-based caps on final score
- If Effective Node Volume score **≤ 2.9** (RSV < 250):
  - Cap final score at **4.5**.
- If Effective Node Volume score **3.0–3.9** (RSV 250–299):
  - Cap final score at **5.5**.
- If Effective Node Volume score **4.0–4.4** (RSV 300–349):
  - Cap final score at **6.5**.

5.2 Extreme anchor override caps
- If there is a **hero/flagship unit within 0–10 m** directly overlapping the new store's core use; and
  - There are **≥ 3 other strong chains within 50 m**, or **≥ 6 within 100 m** on the same flows:
    - Cap final score at **6.5**.
- If there is a hero/flagship within 0–25 m and Saturation & Per-capita Competition score **≤ 4.0**:
  - Cap final score at **7.0**.

5.3 Protection for very strong, less-saturated nodes
- If Effective Node Volume score **≥ 8.0** and Saturation & Per-capita Competition score **≥ 5.0**:
  - Do not cap final score below **7.0** solely due to anchor presence.

5.4 Cross-node spread rules (same city / same decision set)
- Define RSV bands by daily cups:
  - Band A: < 250
  - Band B: 250–349
  - Band C: 350–449
  - Band D: 450–599
  - Band E: 600–799
  - Band F: ≥ 800
- When comparing two locations:
  - If they fall **two or more bands apart** (e.g., B vs D, C vs E):
    - Their final scores should differ by **≥ 2.0 points** in the direction of the higher RSV.
  - If they fall in **adjacent bands** (e.g., C vs D):
    - Their final scores should differ by **≥ 1.0 point** in the direction of the higher RSV.
  - If RSV ratio **≥ 2.0 or ≤ 0.5**:
    - Avoid giving final scores whose **ratio is < 1.3** in the opposite direction or nearly flat.

5.5 Application notes (for report writers)
- Always base Effective Node Volume on **0–50 m flows by daypart**, not entire-station or district traffic.
- Treat **time-based catchments (e.g., 5–10 min walk)** only as support for understanding where users come from, not as direct substitutes for 0–50 m passers.
- In highly saturated CBD / flagship clusters with 40–70 coffee-related outlets in 500 m, default to **low new-store share** unless there is quantified evidence for higher share – but still respect very high effective traffic.
- In dense office clusters with high effective passers and fewer outlets per user, allow RSV and final scores to be **meaningfully higher** than in mid-volume suburban malls with similar raw outlet counts.
