# Competition & Positioning Rubric (Location‑Oriented)

Score **0–10** based on **net competitive favorability**: density vs demand, saturation, positioning white space, and competitive risk.

### Weights (sum = 100%)

1. Competitor Density & Proximity – **30%**
2. Market Saturation vs. Demand – **25%**
3. Positioning Opportunity – **30%**
4. Competitive Risk – **15%**

**Important demand‑adjustment principle:**  
High competitor counts in a **proven high‑demand hub** should **not automatically** yield very low scores. Reserve the lowest scores for locations where many operators actually underperform or fail.

---

## 1. Competitor Density & Proximity (30%)

Evaluate **direct substitutes** within ~300–800 m, their clustering around the site, and overlap with the proposed format.

### Excellent (9–10)

- Balanced or light competition:
  - A few established competitors that validate demand, but clear physical and/or positioning gaps remain.
- No major direct competitor in **immediate adjacency** (e.g., same corridor or entrance) unless the concept is strongly differentiated or complementary.

### Good (7–8)

- Manageable number of competitors:
  - Several operators within walking distance, but not tightly clustered around the exact site.
- Mix of complementary and partially overlapping offers.

### Adequate (5–6)

- Noticeable density of competitors, including **direct substitutes** within ~100–300 m.
- However:
  - Differentiation by price/format/experience is possible, **and/or**
  - Demand in the node is clearly strong enough to support multiple players.
- **Demand‑rich “red” corridors** in major hubs (high traffic, many busy competitors) typically belong here if most stores appear healthy.

> **Hard rule for large hubs:**  
> In locations with **strong Customer (C ≥ 8.5) and Traffic (T ≥ 8.5) scores**, do **not** score this sub‑dimension below **5** purely on the count of competitors, **unless** there is concrete evidence of many weak/empty stores or closures.

### Poor (3–4)

- High density of direct competitors tightly clustered around the site:
  - Many near‑identical offers in the same price tier and format within short walking distance.
- Competitors occupy **best micro‑locations**, leaving limited remaining exposure.
- Use this band when density is high **and** demand appears only moderate.

### Insufficient (0–2)

- **Severe clustering** of direct substitutes with little or no physical or conceptual spacing.
- Clear signs that new entrants struggle to gain traction (numerous closures, chronically empty stores) despite attempts at differentiation.
- Reserve this for demonstrably over‑built sub‑markets, not just “a lot of stores.”

## 2. Market Saturation vs. Demand (25%)

Match **aggregate supply** to **aggregate demand** in the relevant category.

### Excellent (9–10)

- Clear **unmet demand**:
  - Customer queues, long waits, limited seating, or capacity constraints common among incumbents.
- Few if any signs of over‑supply; rents and occupancy are strong.

### Good (7–8)

- Demand likely supports additional entrants:
  - Existing stores are reasonably busy.
  - No systematic discounting or failure pattern.
- New store can grow mainly with **incremental** demand and moderate share capture.

### Adequate (5–6)

- Rough balance between supply and demand:
  - Many operators appear stable but not obviously stretched.
  - Some stores are busy, others average or below.
- Additional entry requires some share capture and/or clear niche positioning.

> In **high‑demand hubs** with many busy stores and few closures, dense competition but healthy performance should normally be scored **5–6**, not **3–4**.

### Poor (3–4)

- Signs of emerging over‑supply:
  - Several operators visibly under‑utilized.
  - Frequent price promotions or discount wars.
  - Slow traffic in off‑peak periods even in good locations.
- New entrant must primarily win share from incumbents, with limited growth in total demand.

### Insufficient (0–2)

- Market appears **fully saturated or shrinking**:
  - Many chronically underperforming units, visible closures, and high turnover.
  - Customer numbers are flat or declining while supply remains high.
- New entry is structurally unlikely to be sustainable.

---

## 3. Positioning Opportunity (30%)

Assess **room to differentiate** on any meaningful axis: price, quality, speed, experience, assortment, daypart, or target segment.

### Excellent (9–10)

- **Clear, sizable white spaces**:
  - Missing price tiers (e.g., no credible premium or no affordable option).
  - Missing formats (e.g., no fast/express vs all sit‑down; no family‑friendly vs all bar‑like).
  - Untapped dayparts (e.g., night‑time, early morning).
- Strong potential to own a distinctive position that is **easy to explain to customers**.

### Good (7–8)

- Several plausible differentiation angles:
  - You can be clearly “best at something” (e.g., fastest, healthiest, most suitable for work, best dessert, kids‑friendly), even if core product overlaps.

### Adequate (5–6)

- Limited but non‑zero differentiation room:
  - You can still fine‑tune offer or atmosphere, but major concepts are already present.
- New concept likely to be “one of many” unless execution is outstanding.

### Poor (3–4)

- Hard to differentiate meaningfully:
  - Most obvious positions (price, quality, convenience, experience) already strongly owned by incumbents.
- New offer risks being perceived as generic or redundant.

### Insufficient (0–2)

- **No viable positioning** apparent:
  - All key niches are saturated **and** competitors are entrenched.
  - Any attempt at differentiation would be extremely narrow or commercially insignificant.

---

## 4. Competitive Risk (15%)

Evaluate the **risk profile** from incumbents, including brand strength, resources, and likelihood of intense competitive responses.

### Excellent (9–10)

- Competitive risk is low:
  - Nearby operators are complementary or serve different segments.
  - No dominant players in direct head‑to‑head format.

### Good (7–8)

- Some competitive pressure, but manageable:
  - Strong brands exist but not in direct conflict, or they have different strengths.
  - Limited history of price wars or aggressive reactions in this category/area.

### Adequate (5–6)

- Clear competitive risks:
  - Well‑known chains or powerful local brands with overlapping propositions.
  - Some risk of promotions or copycat responses, but not constant.

### Poor (3–4)

- High competitive risk:
  - Multiple strong incumbents very close to the proposed site.
  - History or expectation of **frequent price‑based competition** or rapid copycatting.
  - New entrant must be significantly better or cheaper to win.

### Insufficient (0–2)

- Very high risk environment:
  - Dominant incumbent(s) with overwhelming advantages (network, price, landlord relationships) and a track record of defending territory.
  - Highly likely that new store will trigger unsustainable competitive responses.

```json
{
  "score": 5.5,
  "justification": "The area hosts many direct competitors, but strong observed demand and stable performance suggest a demand-rich yet crowded market rather than true oversupply. Several white spaces exist in experience and daypart positioning, while competitive risk is moderate due to entrenched national chains nearby."
