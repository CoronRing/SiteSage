  - 1号口 / 4号口等西侧出口: **~150–210 m**
  - 6号口（北侧）: **~180 m**

**Interpretation:**

- The coffee shop is essentially **at the metro node itself**: most exits are within **1–3 minutes walk**.
- Lines **2 and 10** are both **backbone cross-city commuter lines**:
  - Line 2: connects Pudong Airport – Lujiazui – People’s Square – Nanjing West Road – Hongqiao, etc.
  - Line 10: connects Wujiaochang – Hongqiao area and intersects multiple key job and residential corridors.
- This guarantees **tens of thousands of daily through-traffic**, especially during **weekday peaks**.

### Bus

Closest bus stops:

- **南京东路步行街东侧(公交站)** – ~82 m  
  - City sightseeing line (都市观光旅游1线) / 旅游9线
- **天津路河南中路(公交站)** – ~100 m  
  - Lines: 330路, 37路
- **河南中路南京东路(公交站)** – ~180 m  
  - Lines: 17路, 220路, 306路, 316路/316路夜宵线, 64路, 66路, 805路（旅游观光环线）, 929路, 红色旅游巴士专线
- Multiple additional stops within **200–400 m** in all directions:  
  - 九江路山东中路, 北京东路河南中路, 北京东路四川中路, 汉口路江西中路, 南京路步行街 bus stop, etc. (each ~250–400 m)

**Interpretation:**

- Within a **200 m radius**, passengers can catch **dozens of bus lines**, including:
  - Conventional commuter lines (17, 64, 66, 220, 306, 316, 330, 37, 49 etc.).
  - **Tourist/sightseeing lines**, which boost **weekend and daytime visitor flow**.
- This strongly supports **surface-transport commuters** who might grab takeaway coffee while interchanging between metro and bus or walking toward offices.

### Density of Transit Options (within walking distance)

Within **300 m**:

- Metro: **full 南京东路站 complex**, with **6+ exits**.
- Bus: **5–7 bus stops**, with **15+ lines** total.

Within **600–1,000 m**:

- Additional bus stops in every direction.  
- Walking access to other busy nodes like **人民广场** and the Bund fringe starts to overlap at ~10–15 minutes walk.

**Conclusion on Transit Proximity:**  
Transit accessibility is **exceptional** even by central Shanghai standards; the shop is essentially **on top of a major metro interchange plus multiple bus corridors**.

## 2. Parking Availability

Nearby public / commercial parking (all within ~400 m):

- **恒基名人大厦/恒基名人购物中心地下停车场**  
  - Distance: **~54–70 m** (same building complex as address “南京东路300号”)

- **多家写字楼/酒店地下停车场：**  
  - 华盛大厦、华设大厦、上海置地广场、上海大酒店、上实广场、外滩·老市府、申华金融大厦、九江大楼立体停车场、中央大厦车库等  
  - 全部在 **200–400 m** 范围内。

**Interpretation:**

- **>10 sizable parking facilities** within a **3–5 minute walk**; most are underground lots attached to **malls, office towers, and hotels**.
- For a boutique coffee shop, the main demand is **short-stay convenience parking**:
  - Office workers driving in can park in their building (already satisfied).
  - Hotel/self-driving tourists can park in their hotel/mall lots.
  - Occasional local drivers have multiple public options within **200–300 m**.
- On-street parking on Nanjing East Road is **very limited/impossible** due to pedestrianization and traffic control, but off-street supply compensates well.

**Conclusion on Parking:**  
Private-car access is **sufficient to good** considering the CBD context; lack of curbside parking is not a critical issue for this coffee concept, given strong transit orientation.

- **A:** Store location (南京东路300号)  
- **M:** Representative metro exit area (north-east, several 南京东路站出入口)  
- **O:** Representative office/hotel cluster to the south-east  
- **R:** Office/residential cluster to the south-west  
- **W:** Hotel/office/retail cluster to the north-west

### Typical Walking Detours

1. **Metro commuters (Lines 2 & 10)**  
   - Usual path: Metro exit → directly into Nanjing East Road / Mall corridors → onward to office.  
   - Additional detour to visit store:
     - If they exit via **nearest exits (e.g., 2, 5, 7)**:  
       - Detour is essentially **0–50 m**; the shop can be directly along their upward path or 30–60 seconds off-route.
     - Even from further exits: **100–150 m**, ≈ **1–2 minutes extra**.
   - For morning takeaway, this is well within the **“acceptable detour”** range (most commuters tolerate ≤3 minutes).

2. **Office workers in nearby towers/malls (e.g., Hongyi, Henderson, Mosaic, New World Daimaru)**  
   - Many are **within the same block or adjacent block**, i.e. **50–250 m** walking.
   - Typical detour from lobby to store and back:  
     - **2–6 minutes round trip**, suitable for quick coffee before work or during breaks.

3. **Residents in nearby communities (黄浦东风小区、宁新小区、天津路小区等)**  
   - Within **300–600 m**; walking time:
     - 300 m ≈ **4–5 minutes**
     - 600 m ≈ **8–10 minutes**
   - For a morning coffee walk or evening café visit, this is standard; no special detour beyond a normal neighborhood outing.

4. **Tourists / Hotel guests**  
   - Many hotels are **100–500 m** away.  
   - Their patterns are more leisurely; a **5–10 minute** walk to explore Nanjing East Road is typical.  
   - Detour to specifically choose this coffee shop versus a chain in a mall:  
     - Physically: small; **0–300 m** (0–5 minutes)  
     - Decision factor will be **brand/experience differentiation**, not distance.

**Conclusion on Detour Burden:**

- For **commuters & office workers**, added time cost is **≤2–3 min**, which is **very low**.
- For **residents & tourists**, access is **within comfortable 5–10 min walking**.
- The location sits directly on **natural desire lines** between metro, bus, offices, malls and hotels.

## 4. Visibility Analysis

### Street & Node Visibility

- The address (南京东路300号) is part of a **continuous retail frontage** on one of the **highest-profile pedestrian shopping streets in China**.
- Surrounding uses:  
  - Ground-floor shops, cafés, restaurants, chain F&B, brand retail.  
  - Direct adjacency to **Henderson, Hongyi, Mosaic, Bailian ZX, New World Daimaru**, etc.
- Given this setting:
  - Pedestrian flows are **constant and dense** throughout the day, peaking:
    - **Weekday: 8:00–10:00, 12:00–14:00, 17:00–20:00**
    - **Weekends/holidays: 11:00–20:00** continuous.
  - The store can enjoy **strong frontage exposure**, especially if:
    - Façade is toward Nanjing East Road or main mall concourse.
    - Signage is visible from **metro exit lines of sight** and from the **main pedestrian stream**.

### Road Hierarchy & Landmark Effects

- Nanjing East Road is effectively a **pedestrian-first corridor** but connects at its ends to:
  - **Henan Middle Road, Jiangxi Middle Road, Sichuan Middle Road, Beijing East Road, Jiujiang Road**, etc.
- The area serves as a **CBD–tourist interface** between People’s Square and the Bund, which:
  - Maximizes **casual “discoverability”**: tourists, shoppers, office people all pass multiple cafés.
  - Increases **competition density**, but fundamentally validates **very high base visibility**.

**Visibility Constraints:**

- If the store is **inside-mall, upper-level, or deep corridor**, visibility might drop; customers become more **intent-based** rather than impulse.
- Ground floor with street-facing glass and a clear coffee identity is a major plus.

---

## 5. Overall Accessibility Assessment

**Public Transit Accessibility:**  
- **Outstanding.**  
- Directly integrated with a **major metro interchange (Lines 2 & 10)**, multiple exits **within 50–200 m**, and dense bus coverage in all directions.
- Ideal for **commuter-focused takeaway** and **young professionals / students** who primarily rely on metro/bus.

**Pedestrian Accessibility:**

- Located in a **prime pedestrian district** where walking is the main mode.
- Sidewalks and crossings are well-developed, with safe, attractive pedestrian environment.
- The shop is naturally embedded in **primary walking routes** from metro to offices/malls/hotels.

**Car & Ride-hailing Accessibility:**

- Street access is somewhat constrained:
  - **Limited drive-through ability** on the core pedestrianised segments of Nanjing East Road.
  - Drop-off/pick-up more likely on nearby cross streets (河南中路、江西中路、九江路、北京东路等).
- However:
  - Multiple **underground parking lots within 200–300 m** allow drivers to park once and then walk.
  - Ride-hailing users can be dropped within **100–200 m** and walk a short distance.
- For a boutique coffee shop, which is **not car-dependent**, this is acceptable.

**Cycling / E-bike:**

- Central Huangpu has shared-bike presence, but **bike access is somewhat constrained** on the most crowded parts of Nanjing East Road.
- E-bikes and delivery scooters usually use side streets and alleys; this is good for:
  - **Delivery operations (外卖平台)** to nearby offices, hotels, and residential buildings.
- For customers, cycling is a **minor mode** here compared to walking & transit.

## 6. Weaknesses and Risks

1. **Extreme Competition for Coffee & F&B**
   - Dozens of existing **chain cafés (Starbucks, Luckin, Manner, etc.)**, tea shops, dessert shops and restaurant cafés within **300–500 m**.
   - Customer choice is abundant; traffic is not the issue, **capture rate is**.
   - Differentiation via **quality, ambiance, service and brand story** is essential.

2. **Rent and Cost Pressure**
   - Accessibility and visibility come at the cost of **very high rent**.
   - To justify this:
     - Need **high daily turnover**, especially in morning and afternoon peaks.
     - Efficient use of **small footprint** (high sales per square meter).
     - Potential to tap **premium pricing** and **tourist spending**.

3. **Potential Congestion / Access Friction**
   - During holidays or weekend peak hours:
     - Nanjing East Road can be **overcrowded**, slowing movement and making it slightly less convenient for quick in-and-out.
   - Metro stations at crush-load may cause occasional **wayfinding detours or crowd control**, though they also guarantee huge footfall.

4. **Car-Dependent Customers Not Ideal**
   - Those who insist on **door-front parking** will find the location inconvenient.
   - However, this is a **small segment** of total potential; core targets are transit and pedestrian-based.

5. **Noise / Environmental Factors**
   - Heavy tourist traffic may mean:
     - **Noisier environment**.
     - More short-stay, casual visitors vs. long, quiet working sessions.
   - For “cozy vibe” & “comfortable atmosphere”, interior design and sound management must offset the busy outside.

---

## 7. Alignment with Target Customer Profile

Given the previous customer analysis:

- **Young Professionals & Office Workers**
  - Large office worker base in **Henderson, Hongyi, Mosaic, New World Daimaru** and surrounding towers.
  - Most commute via **metro Lines 2 & 10 or buses**, disembarking within **1–3 min** of the shop.
  - Short detours (≤3 min) make **daily habitual coffee purchases** realistic.
  - Accessibility perfectly aligns with **high-frequency morning and afternoon coffee behavior**.

- **Students & Teachers**
  - Students commuting along Lines 2 & 10 and via the bus network can easily stop by.
  - Lower price sensitivity may be offset by:
    - Occasional visits for **studying/meetups**.
  - The area is not a campus core, but the **transit-central location** still serves student flows.

- **Commuters (Morning Focus)**
  - The store sits at a **metro-node choke point** for east–west and north–south commuter flows.
  - Morning peaks (7:30–9:30) will see **massive passing traffic** right at entrances/sidewalk in front of the shop.
  - If the counter is efficient and visible, the store is well-positioned to win **“habit coffee”** status for a share of these commuters.

- **Tourists & Hotel Guests**
  - 20+ hotels in 500–800 m radius, with **5,000–8,000 daily guests** estimated.
  - These customers:
    - Have **more time** to explore.
    - Look for **quality and atmosphere** over speed.
  - A boutique concept with a cozy interior is **highly compatible**; location along their natural Nanjing East Road walk makes discovery easy.

- **Local Residents**
  - 7,000–12,000 residents within 300–400 m; 8,000+ within 300 m and 77,000+ within 1,000 m.
  - Walkable within **5–10 min**.
  - This provides:
    - **Morning / evening repeat customers** for dine-in and takeaway.
    - Weekends and evenings **“neighborhood café”** function, balancing tourist/office mix.

**Overall Alignment:**  
Accessibility and traffic patterns align **extremely well** with the defined target segments—especially **commuter-heavy, young professional and tourist** profiles. Footfall is structurally strong and diversified across **time of day (morning + daytime + evening)** and **customer types**.

---

## 8. Conclusion

- **Proximity to Public Transit:** Excellent – immediate adjacency to **南京东路站 (Lines 2 & 10)** + dense bus network within 200 m.
- **Parking Availability:** Numerous **underground lots and building car parks within 50–300 m**; more than sufficient for a non-car-centric café.
- **Detour for Customers:** Very small; **0–3 min for metro & office commuters**, **5–10 min walking radius** for residents and hotel guests.
- **Visibility:** High, assuming a street- or primary mall-facing frontage; located in one of Shanghai’s most trafficked pedestrian and retail corridors.
- **Weaknesses:** Intense competition, high rents, some congestion, and not ideal for car-dependent customers.
- **Fit with Target Customers:** Outstanding; the location is tailor-made for **boutique coffee** targeting **young professionals, students and commuting flows**, with a strong secondary base of **tourists and nearby residents**.

From a **traffic and accessibility** standpoint, this is **top-tier** for a boutique coffee shop. The key to success will be **positioning and execution**, not the volume of potential customers.
