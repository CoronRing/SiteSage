## 1. How people will actually use this coffee shop

**Store type & behavior radius**

- Boutique coffee shop, cozy, quality-focused, serving:
  - Morning commuters
  - Office workers (morning + mid-day + some afternoon)
  - Tourists / shoppers (late morning to evening)
  - Nearby residents and students
- On a **high-footfall commercial street directly at a major metro station (Nanjing East Road, Lines 2 & 10)**.
- For this type of shop in this location, meaningful catchment:
  - **Core walk-in radius (very high frequency): ~300–400 m**
  - **Extended walk-in / destination radius: up to ~800–1,000 m**
  - Plus a **huge transient/mall/metro population** that is not captured by residential population data.

The key value here is not how many people *live* nearby, but how many **work, commute, shop, and visit** in and around Nanjing East Road and the Bund.

## 2. Surrounding residential population & age structure

Using WorldPop data around the exact coordinates (31.237549, 121.484103):

### 2.1 Population within different radii

| Radius | Total Population (residential estimate) |
|--------|-----------------------------------------|
| 300 m  | ~8,163 people                          |
| 600 m  | ~31,528 people                         |
| 1,000 m| ~77,398 people                         |

> Note: These are **residential estimates only** and **understate** real customer potential in a central commercial/transit node like Nanjing East Road.

### 2.2 Age distribution (all radii)

All three radii are dominated by the 15–59 group, typical for central Shanghai:

**Within 300 m (~8.1k residents):**

- 0–14: ~449 (5.5%)
- 15–59: ~5,248 (64.3%)
- 60–64: ~714 (8.7%)
- 65+: ~1,393 (17.1%)

**Within 600 m (~31.5k residents):**

- 0–14: ~1,957 (6.2%)
- 15–59: ~21,074 (66.8%)
- 60–64: ~2,727 (8.6%)
- 65+: ~5,432 (17.2%)

**Within 1,000 m (~77.4k residents):**

- 0–14: ~5,222 (6.7%)
- 15–59: ~52,363 (67.7%)
- 60–64: ~6,676 (8.6%)
- 65+: ~13,723 (17.7%)

### 2.3 Fit with your target customers

Your stated targets: **young professionals, students, commuters with morning traffic needs**.

- **15–59 age group (~65–68% of residents)**  
  This is a very strong base of working-age adults. In central Huangpu, this cohort heavily skews to:
  - **White-collar office workers**
  - **Service workers in retail, restaurants, hotels**
- **Students**  
  Residential data doesn’t fully show them, but there is at least one **middle school** very close (see POI section), and likely more educational institutions within 1 km.
- **Elderly (60+) ~25–26% combined**  
  Not your primary target, but they can contribute off-peak (mid-morning, afternoon) if the shop offers comfortable seating and some light food/pastry options.

**Conclusion from demographics alone:**  
Even ignoring transient population, the **resident base within walking distance is substantial and skewed to working age**, which aligns well with a boutique coffee shop concept.

## 3. Nearby places and what they imply for customer flows

Using ~800 m radius around the site, the POI search shows a **dense, mixed-use core**. Below is a simplified classification and what each means for your coffee shop.

### 3.1 Transit – metro & buses (core driver for commuters)

Very close to the shop:

- **Nanjing East Road Metro Station (南京东路地铁站) – Lines 2 & 10**
  - Multiple exits (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) within **30–200 m** of the location.
  - This is a **major interchange and a primary access point** for Nanjing Road commercial street and the Bund.
  - Daily ridership for such central Shanghai stations is typically **well into the hundreds of thousands** (conservative guess: 150k–250k entries/exits per day; this is an estimate, not an official figure).

- **Several bus stops:**
  - 南京东路站 (tourism line 9, city tourism line 1, etc.)
  - 河南中路南京东路站
  - 天津路河南中路站
  - 九江路山东中路站, etc.

**Implication:**  
- **Very strong commuter and tourist transit flow** right at your doorstep.
- Large **“grab-and-go” potential in morning peak (7:30–9:30)** especially from:
  - Office workers transferring between Lines 2 and 10.
  - Employees working in nearby malls and office towers.
  - Tourists staying in nearby hotels heading out for the day.

### 3.2 Retail & shopping malls (office workers + shoppers)

Within roughly 50–200 m:

- **恒基名人购物中心 (Henderson Celebrity Plaza)** – ~35 m
- **宏伊国际广场 / Abun宏伊国际广场** – ~50–80 m
- **悦荟广场 (原悦荟Mosaic, Yuehui Plaza)** – ~100 m
- **百联ZX创趣场 & 上海新世界大丸百货** – ~90–160 m
- **圣德娜商厦** – ~170 m

These are **large-scale shopping centers and department stores** containing:

- Fashion & lifestyle retail
- F&B (fast food, tea shops, dessert shops, casual dining)
- Offices in upper floors in some complexes

**Implication:**

- **Tens of thousands of workers + shoppers daily** within **3–5 minutes’ walk**.
- Strong **daytime crowd (10:00–20:00)**, with:
  - Office workers wanting morning coffee, lunch-time coffee, and mid-afternoon breaks.
  - Shoppers and tourists who are more price-insensitive and open to boutique coffee.
- Being boutique and cozy differentiates you from **mass tea-drink chains** (e.g., HEYTEA-style tenants), which are abundant but often more “to-go, sweet-drink” focused.

### 3.3 Hotels & accommodations (tourists, business travelers)

Nearby hotels include:

- 汉庭酒店 (南京东路地铁站店)
- 全季酒店 (外滩九江路店 / 山东中路店)
- 上海艾迪逊酒店 (The Shanghai EDITION – 5-star, ~170 m)
- 上海宝地朴乐里酒店
- 上海外滩南京路步行街桔子水晶酒店
- 锦江都城经典酒店 (南京路步行街南京饭店)
- 如家精选、海友酒店等经济型连锁

Rough, conservative estimate within ~500–800 m:

- **20+ hotels, several thousand rooms total** (likely 4,000–6,000+ room inventory in the broader Nanjing East Rd/Bund area).

Assuming modest occupancy (70–80%) and 1.5–2 guests per occupied room:

- **Daily tourist/guest base in walking distance easily exceeds 5,000–8,000 people**.

**Implication:**

- Tourists and business travelers:
  - Often desire **quality coffee** and a **comfortable space**, especially Western and young domestic travelers.
  - Are active from **8:00 onwards**, with strong **late-morning and afternoon coffee demand**.
  - 5-star hotel guests (e.g., from EDITION) are more price-insensitive and likely to appreciate boutique quality.

### 3.4 Residential compounds (local regulars)

Within ~200 m:

- 黄浦东风小区
- 东风小区东区 (includes multiple entrances: 东区, 东区天津路195弄, etc.)
- 天津路138弄小区
- 宁新小区
- 汉口小区
- 天津路170弄小区
- Additional residential clusters along 宁波路, 天津路, 汉口路, etc.

These are **mid- to high-density inner-city residential communities**.

Very rough, conservative estimate:

- Each named 小区 likely has **300–800 households**.
- In total, within 300–400 m you easily have **3,000–5,000 households**, translating to perhaps **7,000–12,000 residents** – somewhat consistent with the 300–600 m WorldPop residential figures.

**Implication:**

- Morning and weekend **local resident traffic**:
  - White-collar residents walking to metro can be **daily repeat coffee customers**.
  - Younger residents and families might adopt the shop as a **“neighborhood third place”** on weekends and evenings.

### 3.5 Offices / schools / institutions

From the POIs:

- **上海市格致初级中学（应昌期围棋校区）** – ~165 m
- Several commercial buildings and mixed-use towers (often named as 广场, 商厦, etc., which usually have office floors above retail).

Given Nanjing East Road’s status as a **prime CBD/retail corridor near the Bund**, there are numerous office workers:

- In Henderson, Hongyi, Saint-Dena, and other commercial towers:  
  Likely **thousands of white-collar employees** within a 5–10 minute walk.

**Implication:**

- **Strong weekday daytime demand** from:
  - Office workers grabbing coffee before 9:00.
  - 10:00–11:00 and 14:00–16:00 coffee breaks.
  - Some small meetings (if your shop has seating and quiet corners).

### 3.6 Tourism & attractions

Nearby:

- 南京路步行街本身 – one of China’s most famous shopping streets.
- 失恋博物馆 (small attraction, but signals a youth-oriented, social-media crowd).
- 观光巴士站点 (city sightseeing bus lines).
- External Bund/Bund area is a short walk away.

**Implication:**

- **Tourist-heavy** area with:
  - Young travelers
  - Couples and friend groups
  - High social-media usage and interest in “instagrammable”/“小红书风” coffee spots.
- Strong weekend & holiday traffic, plus **evening strolls** even if your primary focus is morning.

## 4. Quantitative view of customer potential (by radius)

While precise daily footfall data is not available here, we can synthesize:

### 4.1 0–300 m (core, extremely high-value catchment)

Residential:  
- ~8,000 residents, with ~5,200 aged 15–59.

Non-residential (conservative guesses):

- Metro entries/exits via multiple station gates:  
  - At least **20–40k** people per day **passing within 100–200 m** of the store.
- Mall & office workers (Henderson, Hongyi, Yuehui, etc.):
  - Likely **5,000–10,000 employees** within 3–5 min walk.
- Nearby hotels (within 300–400 m):  
  - Possibly **1,500–3,000 guests per day**.

**Core conclusion:**  
Your **address is practically at the node where metro exits, shopping malls, hotels, and residential streets converge**. For a boutique coffee shop, this is an **exceptionally strong micro-location**.

### 4.2 300–600 m

Residential:  
- Total ~31,500 residents (residential estimate), mostly working age.

Non-residential:

- Many more residential blocks, hotels, malls, and offices appear in this ring.
- Easy **5–10 minute walk** distance. For people with routines (office workers, locals), walking 400–600 m for better coffee is acceptable.

**Implication:**  
This ring expands your base of **regulars and office workers** who may not be right at the station, but still within comfortable walking distance.

### 4.3 600–1,000 m

Residential:  
- ~77,400 residents.

Non-residential:

- Includes more of Nanjing Road East and West segments, more hotels, more office towers, and possibly some universities or training centers in the broader CBD.

**Implication:**  
This radius is more about **brand reach and “destination” visits** (people deliberately choosing your shop) rather than pure convenience.

## 5. Main customer sources for this coffee shop

Based on all the above, the **key customer streams** and their logic:

### 5.1 Metro commuters & bus riders (Top Priority for Morning Peak)

## 6. Alignment with your concept

Your concept: **“A cozy-vibe boutique coffee shop focusing on quality coffee and a comfortable atmosphere”** with **morning peak prioritized**.

### Strong alignment:

- **Morning commuter capture:**  
  Metro & bus concentration gives **very strong morning demand** for takeaway.
- **Young professionals:**  
  High density of office workers in a 300–600 m radius.
- **Students & young crowd:**  
  Nanjing Road’s retail profile and nearby school(s) provide **youth-heavy footfall**.
- **Cozy & boutique positioning:**  
  Different from fast-turnover milk tea or standardized coffee chains; can appeal strongly to:
  - Tourists seeking a “nice place to sit”
  - Young professionals wanting a more “curated” experience
  - Social-media-oriented customers (小红书/抖音打卡地)

### Things to be mindful of:

- **Competition:**  
  This area will almost certainly already have:
  - International chains (Starbucks, Luckin, etc.)
  - New-style tea chains and dessert cafés.
- **Positioning strategy:**  
  You must stand out via:
  - Coffee quality and stability
  - Interior design and comfort
  - Possibly specialty/hand-brew, single origins, etc.
  - Clear differentiation in brand story and service style.

## 7. Limitations and data notes

- Population figures are from **WorldPop raster estimates**:
  - They measure **residential density only** and exclude:
    - Daily commuters who work here but live elsewhere.
    - Tourists/hotel guests.
    - Pass-through metro/bus passengers who never “reside” here.
  - In this location, **the real daily human presence is several times higher** than residential counts.
- POI data:
  - Based on Amap categories; some places may be misclassified or missing.
  - Office worker and hotel guest counts are **reasoned estimates**, not official numbers.
- No direct measurement of **footfall intensity by time of day** is available here; actual on-site counts would refine the forecast.

---

## 8. Summary

1. **Residential base:**  
   - Within 1 km, ~77k residents; within 300 m, ~8k, with **~65–68% working age** – a solid local base.

2. **Transit & flow:**  
   - Adjacent to **Nanjing East Road Metro Station (Lines 2 & 10)** with multiple exits and heavy bus coverage.  
   - Daily **transient population (commuters + tourists)** likely in the **hundreds of thousands** around the station and Nanjing Road.

3. **Commercial and tourism environment:**  
   - Dense cluster of **malls, department stores, and office/commercial towers** within 200 m.
   - Many **hotels from economy to 5-star**, generating thousands of guests daily.
   - Nanjing Road pedestrian street and the Bund area bring sustained **tourist and shopper flows**.

4. **Main customer sources:**
   - **Metro & bus commuters** (strongest morning potential).
   - **Office workers** in surrounding malls and towers (daily, repeat customers).
   - **Tourists and hotel guests** (higher spend, daytime and weekend).
   - **Nearby residents** (stable base, especially mornings and weekends).
   - **Students/school-related visitors** (supplementary off-peak demand).

5. **Overall judgment of customer potential:**  
   - For a **boutique coffee shop targeting young professionals, students, and commuters with a focus on morning peak**, this location is **exceptionally favorable** in terms of **footfall potential, demographic fit, and transit accessibility**.  
   - The main challenge will be **competition and differentiation**, not lack of demand.

If you’d like, I can next estimate **potential daily cup volumes** (low/medium/high scenarios) based on typical capture rates for similar high-footfall CBD locations.
