    "report_md": "# Understanding\n\nThe planned boutique coffee shop is intended to have a cozy atmosphere targeting young professionals and students, with a clear emphasis on capturing strong morning traffic. The chosen location is near **上海市黄浦区南京东路300号 (Apple 南京东路)**, in the core commercial district.\n\nSpatially, this address sits along **南京东路**, a major, high-intensity shopping and commercial corridor with continuous ground-floor retail. The static map shows dense mixed-use surroundings: multiple office/commercial towers, numerous shops and restaurants along Nanjing East Road and its side streets, hotels, and several nearby residential compounds within a short walk. This indicates very strong pedestrian activity throughout the day.\n\nTransport access is excellent: the location is adjacent to **Nanjing East Road Metro Station**, a major rail node that feeds heavy commuter flows, especially during peak hours. The site is on or just off a main commercial artery, supporting high visibility from street-level pedestrians and easy access by public transport and vehicles.\n\nFor a boutique coffee shop aiming at **young professionals and students with strong morning traffic**, this environment is highly supportive: heavy commuter footfall, dense office populations, and significant general retail traffic. Competition from other F&B and café operators will be intense, but the corridor itself is clearly proven as a strong demand cluster for daily coffee and quick-service offerings.\n\n**Static map view:**\n\n![Map view of target location](https://restapi.amap.com/v3/staticmap?location=121.484103%2C31.237549&zoom=15&size=512%2A512&markers=mid%2C%2CA%3A121.484103%2C31.237549&key=68913ce8db83f7bbe5b4cca9720c7a8f)\n"
