# Weighting Rationale

Based on the business context of a boutique coffee shop designed to appeal to young professionals and students, the following weight distribution was chosen:

**Customer (0.33):** The shop is designed to attract a specific demographic that values ambiance and quality, such as young professionals and students. Therefore, customer analysis is important to ensure that the store aligns with the preferences and characteristics of these target groups.

**Traffic & Accessibility (0.38):** Given the desire to attract a steady stream of morning traffic, being situated in a location with high foot traffic and accessibility is paramount. This ensures that the shop can capture both intentional visits and spontaneous walk-ins, essential for maximizing daily turnover.

**Competition (0.29):** Although competition is intense in urban coffee shop settings, the boutique nature provides some differentiation through ambiance and unique offerings. While important, it is slightly less critical than customer targeting and traffic due to efforts in creating a unique experience.

These weights reflect a strategic focus on attracting the desired demographic while ensuring accessibility in a high-traffic area, enabling the coffee shop to thrive despite significant competition.
